# Abstract:

Individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR) have variable clinical outcomes and low conversion rates, limiting development of novel and personalized treatments. Moreover, given risks of antipsychotic drugs, safer effective medications for CHR individuals are needed. The Accelerating Medicines Partnership(r) Schizophrenia (AMP(r) SCZ) Program was launched to address this need. Based on past CHR and schizophrenia studies, AMP SCZ assessed electroencephalography (EEG)-based event-related potential (ERP), event-related oscillation (ERO), and resting EEG power spectral density (PSD) measures, including mismatch negativity (MMN), auditory and visual P300 to target (P3b) and novel (P3a) stimuli, 40-Hz auditory steady state response, and resting EEG PSD for traditional frequency bands (eyes open/closed). Here, in an interim analysis of AMP SCZ EEG measures, we assess test-retest reliability and stability over sessions (baseline, month-2 follow-up) in CHR (n = 654) and community control (CON; n = 87) participants. Reliability was calculated as Generalizability (G)-coefficients, and changes over session were assessed with paired t-tests. G-coefficients were generally good to excellent in both groups (CHR: mean = 0.72, range = 0.49-0.85; CON: mean = 0.71, range = 0.44-0.89). Measure magnitudes significantly (p < 0.001) decreased over session (MMN, auditory and visual target P3b, visual novel P3a, 40-Hz ASSR) and/or over runs within sessions (MMN, auditory/visual novel P3a and target P3b), consistent with habituation effects. Despite these small systematic habituation effects, test-retest reliabilities of the AMP SCZ EEG-based measures are sufficiently strong to support their use in CHR studies as potential predictors of clinical outcomes, markers of illness progression, and/or target engagement or secondary outcome measures in controlled clinical trials.(c) 2025.
