# Abstract:

The Accelerating Medicines Partnership Schizophrenia (AMP(r) SCZ) program integrates lived experience into psychosis research, leveraging over three decades of foundational studies to improve research quality, promote community engagement, and ensure ethical implementation of precision psychiatry. Lived experience is embedded in the program's governance, shaping study protocols, recruitment strategies, and digital tools such as the mindLAMP platform. Study sites also integrate lived experience through youth advisory boards, peer support specialists, and advisory committees, ensuring diverse perspectives inform research design and implementation. These efforts aim to develop predictive tools and therapeutic strategies while maintaining ethical and participant-centered practices. Advocacy organizations, such as the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), have fostered collaboration among government, industry, and academic partners, shaping outreach and engagement strategies. Dissemination efforts, led by the Website and Outreach Workgroup (WOW), include an accessible, Section 508-compliant website and co-designed resources, building trust and engagement within communities. By integrating lived experience at every stage, the program aims to foster trust, enhance research outcomes, and inform future strategies for treatment and prevention.
