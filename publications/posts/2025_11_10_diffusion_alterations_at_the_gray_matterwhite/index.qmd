# Abstract:

Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease associated with exposure to repetitive head impacts (RHI). In CTE, hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) aggregates are found in neurons at the depth of cortical sulci close to the gray matter/white matter (GM/WM) boundary. To date, CTE can only be diagnosed postmortem by neuropathological examination. Traumatic encephalopathy syndrome (TES) is the clinical syndrome purported to be associated with CTE pathology. The aim of this study is to investigate microstructural properties at the GM/WM boundary in individuals with a history of exposure to RHI and clinical features of CTE (i.e., TES). Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI), TES diagnoses, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers were acquired from 165 male former American football players (age: 57.29 +- 8.23 years) from the DIAGNOSE CTE Research Project, a multicenter, observational cohort study. Fractional anisotropy (FA) was measured at the GM/WM boundary of the whole brain. In addition, a widely used method (tract-based spatial statistics [TBSS]) was applied to measure FA of central WM. We used analyses of covariance to test associations between FA and TES. Furthermore, we used linear regressions to test associations between FA and nine CSF biomarkers (i.e., p-tau-181, -217, -231, total tau, amyloid b [Ab]1-40, Ab1-42, glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP], neurofilament light [NfL], and soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 [sTREM2]). We report an association between higher FA at the GM/WM boundary and higher levels of certainty for CTE pathology (F(1, 147) = 5.781, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.0003-0.003, p = 0.035) as well as neurobehavioral dysregulation (F(1, 148) = 7.559, 95% CI = 0.001-0.009, p = 0.020), and functional dependence/dementia (F(1, 148) = 5.046, 95% CI = 0.0004-0.006, p = 0.039). In addition, we report an association between higher FA at the GM/WM boundary and higher CSF p-tau-181 (b = 0.272, 95% CI = 0.078-0.466, p = 0.029) and p-tau-217 (b = 0.295, 95% CI = 0.102-0.488, p = 0.027). FA of the central WM was not associated with TES diagnoses. Taken together, these findings suggest that dMRI at the GM/WM boundary could be used to investigate microstructural alterations suggestive of tau pathology-associated neurodegeneration in individuals with TES, the clinical presentation of CTE. Future studies are needed to validate this approach and to identify clinically useful cutoff values for dMRI metrics.
