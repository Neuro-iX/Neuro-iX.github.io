Previous studies report axonal injury and oedema in the first week after injury in a rodent model. This study aims to investigate the processes occurring 1 week after injury at the time of regeneration and degeneration using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in the impact acceleration rat mTBI model.\nRESEARCH DESIGN: Eighteen rats were subjected to impact acceleration injury, and three rats served as sham controls. Seven days post injury, DTI was acquired from fixed rat brains using a 7T scanner. Group comparison of Fractional Anisotropy (FA) values between traumatized and sham animals was performed using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS), a method that we adapted for rats.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: TBSS revealed white matter regions of the brain with increased FA values in the traumatized versus sham rats, localized mainly to the contrecoup region. Regions of increased FA included the pyramidal tract, the cerebral peduncle, the superior cerebellar peduncle and to a lesser extent the fibre tracts of the corpus callosum, the anterior commissure, the fimbria of the hippocampus, the fornix, the medial forebrain bundle and the optic chiasm.\nCONCLUSION: Seven days post injury, during the period of tissue reparation in the impact acceleration rat model of mTBI, microstructural changes to white matter can be detected using DTI."

    "text": "Abstract:\nBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Late neuropathologies of repetitive head impacts from contact sports can include chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and white matter degeneration. White matter hyperintensities (WMH) on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI scans are often viewed as microvascular disease from vascular risk, but might have unique underlying pathologies and risk factors in the setting of repetitive head impacts. We investigated the neuropathologic correlates of antemortem WMH in brain donors exposed to repetitive head impacts. The association between WMH and repetitive head impact exposure and informant-reported cognitive and daily function were tested.\nMETHODS: This imaging-pathologic correlation study included symptomatic male decedents exposed to repetitive head impacts. Donors had antemortem FLAIR scans from medical records and were without evidence of CNS neoplasm, large vessel infarcts, hemorrhage, or encephalomalacia. WMH were quantified using log-transformed values for total lesion volume (TLV), calculated using the lesion prediction algorithm from the Lesion Segmentation Toolbox. Neuropathologic assessments included semiquantitative ratings of white matter rarefaction, cerebrovascular disease, hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) severity (CTE stage, dorsolateral frontal cortex), and b-amyloid (Ab). Among football players, years of play was a proxy for repetitive head impact exposure. Retrospective informant-reported cognitive and daily function were assessed using the Cognitive Difficulties Scale (CDS) and Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ). Regression models controlled for demographics, diabetes, hypertension, and MRI resolution. Statistical significance was defined as p &lt;= 0.05.\nRESULTS: The sample included 75 donors: 67 football players and 8 nonfootball contact sport athletes or military veterans. Dementia was the most common MRI indication (64%). Fifty-three (70.7%) had CTE at autopsy. Log TLV was associated with white matter rarefaction (odds ratio [OR] 2.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03, 5.24; p = 0.04), arteriolosclerosis (OR 2.38, 95% CI 1.02, 5.52; p = 0.04), CTE stage (OR 2.58, 95% CI 1.17, 5.71; p = 0.02), and dorsolateral frontal p-tau severity (OR 3.03, 95% CI 1.32, 6.97; p = 0.01). There was no association with Ab. More years of football play was associated with log TLV (unstandardized b 0.04, 95% CI 0.01, 0.06; p = 0.01). Greater log TLV correlated with higher FAQ (unstandardized b 4.94, 95% CI 0.42, 8.57; p = 0.03) and CDS scores (unstandardized b 15.35, 95% CI -0.27, 30.97; p = 0.05).\nDISCUSSION: WMH might capture long-term white matter pathologies from repetitive head impacts, including those from white matter rarefaction and p-tau, in addition to microvascular disease. Prospective imaging-pathologic correlation studies are needed.\nCLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class IV evidence of associations between FLAIR white matter hyperintensities and neuropathologic changes (white matter rarefaction, arteriolosclerosis, p-tau accumulation), years of American football play, and reported cognitive symptoms in symptomatic brain donors exposed to repetitive head impacts."

    "text": "Abstract:\nExposure to repetitive head impacts (RHIs) in contact sports is associated with neurodegenerative disorders including chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) which currently can be diagnosed only at postmortem. American football players are at higher risk of developing CTE given their exposure to RHIs. One promising approach for diagnosing CTE in vivo is to explore known neuropathological abnormalities at postmortem in living individuals using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI brain morphometry was evaluated in 170 male former American football players ages 45-74 years (n = 114 professional; n = 56 college) and 54 same-age unexposed asymptomatic male controls (n = 58 age range 45-74). Cortical thickness and volume of regions of interest were selected based on established CTE pathology findings and were assessed using FreeSurfer. Group differences and interactions with age and exposure factors were evaluated using a generalized least squares model. A separate logistic regression and independent multinomial model were performed to predict each Traumatic Encephalopathy Syndrome (TES) diagnosis core clinical features and provisional level of certainty for CTE pathology using brain regions of interest. Former college and professional American football players (combined) showed significant cortical thickness and/or volume reductions compared to unexposed asymptomatic controls in the hippocampus amygdala entorhinal cortex parahippocampal gyrus insula temporal pole and superior frontal gyrus. Post-hoc analyses identified group-level differences between former professional players and unexposed asymptomatic controls in the hippocampus amygdala entorhinal cortex parahippocampal gyrus insula and superior frontal gyrus. Former college players showed significant volume reductions in the hippocampus amygdala and superior frontal gyrus compared to the unexposed asymptomatic controls. We did not observe age-by-group interactions for brain morphometric measures. Interactions between morphometry and exposure measures were limited to a single significant positive association between the age of first exposure to organized tackle football and right insular volume. We found no significant relationship between brain morphometric measures and the TES diagnosis core clinical features and provisional level of certainty for CTE pathology outcomes. These findings suggest that MRI morphometrics detects abnormalities in individuals with a history of RHI exposure that resemble the anatomic distribution of pathological findings from postmortem CTE studies. The lack of findings associating MRI measures with exposure metrics (except for one significant relationship) or TES diagnosis and core clinical features suggests that brain morphometry must be complemented by other types of measures to characterize individuals with RHIs.(c) The Author(s) 2024.

    "text": "Abstract:\nPsychotic disorders are severe, debilitating, and even fatal. The development of targeted and effective interventions for psychosis depends upon on clear understanding of the timing and nature of disease progression to target processes amenable to intervention. Strong evidence suggests early and ongoing neuroprogressive changes, but timing and inflection points remain unclear and likely differ across cognitive, clinical, and brain measures. Additionally, granular evidence across modalities is particularly sparse in the “bridging years” between first episode and established illness-years that may be especially critical for improving outcomes and during which interventions may be maximally effective. Our objective is the systematic, multimodal characterization of neuroprogression through the early course of illness in a cross-diagnostic sample of patients with psychosis. We aim to (1) interrogate neurocognition, structural brain measures, and network connectivity at multiple assessments over the first eight years of illness to map neuroprogressive trajectories, and (2) examine trajectories as predictors of clinical and functional outcomes. We will recruit 192 patients with psychosis and 36 healthy controls. Assessments will occur at baseline and 8- and 16-month follow ups using clinical, cognitive, and imaging measures. We will employ an accelerated longitudinal design (ALD), which permits ascertainment of data across a longer timeframe and at more frequent intervals than would be possible in a single cohort longitudinal study. Results from this study are expected to hasten identification of actionable treatment targets that are closely associated with clinical outcomes, and identify subgroups who share common neuroprogressive trajectories toward the development of individualized treatments."

Despite all the knowledge accrued, direct information about connections, from origin to termination, in the human brain is extremely limited. Yet there is a widespread misperception that human connectional neuroanatomy is well-established and validated. In this article, we consider what is known directly about human structural and connectional neuroanatomy. Information on neuroanatomical connections in the human brain is derived largely from studies in non-human experimental models in which the entire connectional pathway, including origins, course, and terminations, is directly visualized. Techniques to examine structural connectivity in the human brain are progressing rapidly; nevertheless, our present understanding of such connectivity is limited largely to data derived from homological comparisons, particularly with non-human primates. We take the position that an in-depth and more precise understanding of human connectional neuroanatomy will be obtained by a systematic application of this homological approach.Copyright (c) 2020 Rushmore, Bouix, Kubicki, Rathi, Yeterian and Makris."

Careful operationalization of cognitive impairment is essential to improving the diagnostic specificity and accuracy of TES criteria. We compared single- versus two-test criteria for cognitive impairment in their associations with CSF and imaging biomarkers in male former American football players. Method: 169 participants from the DIAGNOSE CTE Research Project completed neuropsychological tests of memory and executive functioning. Cognitive impairment was identified by single-test criteria (z&lt;=-1.5 on one test) and two-test criteria (z&lt;-1 on two tests within a domain). ANCOVAs adjusting for age, race, education, body mass index, word-reading score, and APOE e4 status assessed whether single- or two-test criteria predicted CSF markers (Ab1-42, p-tau181, p-tau181/Ab1-42, total tau, neurofilament light [NfL], glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]) and MRI markers (hippocampal volume, cortical thickness, white matter hyperintensities). Results: Ninety-nine participants met single-test criteria for cognitive impairment. Sixty-six met two-test criteria. Participants who met two-test criteria had greater exposure to RHI than those who did not (p=.04). Two-test criteria were -associated with higher CSF p-tau181/Ab1-42 (q=.02) and CSF NfL (q=.02). The association between two-test criteria and CSF NfL remained after excluding amyloid-positive participants (q=.04). Single-test criteria were not associated with any biomarkers (q’s&gt;.05). Conclusions: Two-test but not single-test criteria for cognitive impairment were associated with markers of neurodegeneration. Future clinical research in TES may benefit from applying two-test criteria to operationalize cognitive impairment."

    "text": "Abstract:\nDecades of psychosis research highlight the prevalence and the clinical significance of negative emotions, such as fear and anxiety. Translational evidence demonstrates the pivotal role of the amygdala in fear and anxiety. However, most of these approaches have used hypothesis-driven analyses with predefined regions of interest. A data-driven analysis may provide a complimentary, unbiased approach to identifying brain correlates of fear and anxiety. The aim of the current study was to identify the brain basis of fear and anxiety in early psychosis and controls using a data-driven approach. We analyzed data from the Human Connectome Project for Early Psychosis, a multi-site study of 125 people with psychosis and 58 controls with resting-state fMRI and clinical characterization. Multivariate pattern analysis of whole-connectome data was used to identify shared and psychosis-specific brain correlates of fear and anxiety using the NIH Toolbox Fear-Affect and Fear-Somatic Arousal scales. We then examined clinical correlations of Fear-Affect scores and connectivity patterns. Individuals with psychosis had higher levels of Fear-Affect scores than controls (p &lt; 0.05). The data-driven analysis identified a cluster encompassing the amygdala and hippocampus where connectivity was correlated with Fear-Affect score (p &lt; 0.005) in the entire sample. The strongest correlate of Fear-Affect was between this cluster and the anterior insula and stronger connectivity was associated with higher Fear-Affect scores (r = 0.31, p = 0.0003). The multivariate pattern analysis also identified a psychosis-specific correlate of Fear-Affect score between the amygdala/hippocampus cluster and a cluster in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC). Higher Fear-Affect scores were correlated with stronger amygdala/hippocampal-VMPFC connectivity in the early psychosis group (r = 0.33, p = 0.002), but not in controls (r = -0.15, p = 0.28). The current study provides evidence for the transdiagnostic role of the amygdala, hippocampus, and anterior insula in the neural basis of fear and anxiety and suggests a psychosis-specific relationship between fear and anxiety symptoms and amygdala/hippocampal-VMPFC connectivity. Our novel data-driven approach identifies novel, psychosis-specific treatment targets for fear and anxiety symptoms and provides complimentary evidence to decades of hypothesis-driven approaches examining the brain basis of threat processing.(c) 2024.

    "text": "Abstract:\nMilitary service members are at increased risk for mental health issues, and comorbidity with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is common. Largely overlapping symptoms between conditions suggest a shared pathophysiology. The present work investigates the associations among white matter microstructure, psychological functioning, and serum neuroactive steroids that are part of the stress-response system. Diffusion-weighted brain imaging was acquired from 163 participants (with and without military affiliation) and free-water-corrected fractional anisotropy (FAT) was extracted. Associations between serum neurosteroid levels of allopregnanolone (ALLO) and pregnenolone (PREGNE), psychological functioning, and whole-brain white matter microstructure were assessed using regression models. Moderation models tested the effect of mTBI and comorbid post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and mTBI on these associations. ALLO is associated with whole-brain white matter FAT (b = 0.24, t = 3.05, p = 0.006). This association is significantly modulated by PTSD+mTBI comorbidity (b = 0.00, t = 2.50, p = 0.027), although an mTBI diagnosis alone did not significantly impact this association (p = 0.088). There was no significant association between PREGNE and FAT (p = 0.380). Importantly, lower FAT is associated with poor psychological functioning (b = -0.19, t = -2.35, p = 0.020). This study provides novel insight into a potential common pathophysiological mechanism of neurosteroid dysregulation underlying the high risk for mental health issues in military service members. Further, comorbidity of PTSD and mTBI may bring the compensatory effects of the brain’s stress response to their limit. Future research is needed to investigate whether neurosteroid regulation may be a promising tool for restoring brain health and improving psychological functioning."

    "text": "Abstract:\nBACKGROUND: Neurocognitive impairment is a well-known phenomenon in schizophrenia that begins prior to psychosis onset. Connectome-wide association studies have inconsistently linked cognitive performance to resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. We hypothesized that a carefully selected cognitive instrument and refined population would allow identification of reliable brain-behavior associations with connectome-wide association studies. To test this hypothesis, we first identified brain-cognition correlations via a connectome-wide association study in early psychosis. We then asked, in an independent dataset, if these brain-cognition relationships would generalize to individuals who develop psychosis in the future.\nMETHODS: The Seidman Auditory Continuous Performance Task (ACPT) effectively differentiates healthy participants from those with psychosis. Our connectome-wide association study used the HCP-EP (Human Connectome Project for Early Psychosis) (n = 183) to identify links between connectivity and ACPT performance. We then analyzed data from the NAPLS2 (North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study 2) (n = 345), a multisite prospective study of individuals at risk for psychosis. We tested the connectome-wide association study-identified cognition-connectivity relationship in both individuals at risk for psychosis and control participants.\nRESULTS: Our connectome-wide association study in early-course psychosis identified robust associations between better ACPT performance and higher prefrontal-somatomotor connectivity (p &lt; .005). Prefrontal-somatomotor connectivity was also related to ACPT performance in at-risk individuals who would develop psychosis (n = 17). This finding was not observed in nonconverters (n = 196) or control participants (n = 132).\nCONCLUSIONS: This connectome-wide association study identified reproducible links between connectivity and cognition in separate samples of individuals with psychosis and at-risk individuals who would later develop psychosis. A carefully selected task and population improves the ability of connectome-wide association studies to identify reliable brain-phenotype relationships."

Statistical analyses were conducted between January 2023 and May 2025.\nEXPOSURE: CHR status using 2 definitions: (1) a symptoms-only definition based on the positive symptoms from the Scale of Prodromal Symptoms and (2) a symptoms-and-function definition based on positive symptoms and the modified Global Assessment of Functioning.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were remission incidence, prevalence, and stability for 7 follow-up visits over 2 years. Associations of remission with age, sex at birth, race, antipsychotic and antidepressant medication, history of trauma, and cognitive performance were determined using mixed-effects logistic regression.\nRESULTS: The sample included 692 individuals (mean [SD] age, 18.7 [4.1] years; 319 female [46%]) at baseline, with 614 completing at least 1 follow-up. For the symptoms-only definition, 7% (95% CI, 5%-10%) met remission criteria after 2 months, 34% (95% CI, 31%-38%) met remission criteria at least once during the study, and 26% (95% CI, 22%-29%) met criteria at their last visit. The symptoms-and-function definition was associated with a lower remission incidence and prevalence, with 4% (95%CI, 2%-5%) meeting remission criteria after 2 months, 21% (95% CI, 18%-24%) meeting criteria at least once, and 15% (95% CI, 13%-18%) meeting criteria at their last visit. Under the symptoms-only definition, 83 of 153 individuals at CHR with at least 1 follow-up after remission (54%; 95% CI, 46%-62%) were stable remitters. Under the symptoms-and-function definition, 43 of 91 individuals (47%; 95% CI, 37%-58%) were stable remitters. The chance of staying in remission rose drastically once a person had more than 1 previous recorded remission visit. Higher functioning was associated with higher likelihood of remission (current score for symptoms only: OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.08; current score for symptoms and function: OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.02-1.14). More symptoms at baseline was associated with a lower likelihood of remission (general symptoms for symptoms only: OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.70-0.84; general symptoms for symptoms and function: OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.69-0.92).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that CHR status is a dynamic state and that vulnerability can persist even after functional remission. Hence, continued follow-up and facilitated reengagement with clinical services after remission are essential."

Traumatic encephalopathy syndrome (TES) is a proposed clinical syndrome thought to be linked to neuropath-ology of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a condition associated with RHI from football. Cognitive intra-individual variability (d-CIIV) measures test-score dispersion, indicating cognitive dysfunction. This study examined d-CIIV in former football players and its associations with TES diagnosis, RHI exposure, and DTI and CSF biomarkers. Methods: Data included 237 males (45-74 years) from DIAGNOSE CTE Research Project, including former professional and college football players (COL) (n = 173) and asymptomatic men without RHI or TBI (n = 55). Participants completed neuropsychological tests. TES diagnosis was based on 2021 NINDS TES criteria. Years of football play and a cumulative head impact index (CHII) measured RHI exposure. Lumipulse technology was used for CSF assays. DTI fractional anisotropy assessed white matter integrity. Coefficient of variation (CoV) measured d-CIIV. ANCOVA compared d-CIIV among groups (football versus control; TES-status). Pearson correlations and linear regressions tested associations between d-CIIV, RHI exposure, and CSF and DTI biomarkers. Results: Former professional players had higher d-CIIV than controls (F(7, 194) = 2.87, p = .007). d-CIIV was associated with TES diagnosis (F(8, 146) = 9.063, p &lt; .001), with highest d-CIIV in TES Possible/Probable-CTE. Higher d-CIIV correlated with higher CHII scores (r = 0.19), reduced CSF Ab1-42 (b = -0.302), increased p-tau181 (b = 0.374), and reduced DTI FA (b = -0.202). Conclusion: d-CIIV is linked to RHI exposure and TES diagnosis in former football players, with associated changes in CSF biomarkers and white matter integrity."

To date, most studies involving MRI in CHR are likely not sufficiently powered to generate robust and generalizable neuroimaging results. Here, we describe the prospective, advanced, and modern neuroimaging protocol that was implemented in a complex multi-site, multi-vendor environment, as part of the large-scale Accelerating Medicines Partnership(r) Schizophrenia Program (AMP(r) SCZ), including the rationale for various choices. This protocol includes T1- and T2-weighted structural scans, resting-state fMRI, and diffusion-weighted imaging collected at two time points, approximately 2 months apart. We also present preliminary variance component analyses of several measures, such as signal- and contrast-to-noise ratio (SNR/CNR) and spatial smoothness, to provide quantitative data on the relative percentages of participant, site, and platform (i.e., scanner model) variance. Site-related variance is generally small (typically &lt;10%). For the SNR/CNR measures from the structural and fMRI scans, participant variance is the largest component (as desired; 40-76%). However, for SNR/CNR in the diffusion scans, there is substantial platform-related variance (&gt;55%) due to differences in the diffusion imaging hardware capabilities of the different scanners. Also, spatial smoothness generally has a large platform-related variance due to inherent, difficult to control, differences between vendors in their acquisitions and reconstructions. These results illustrate some of the factors that will need to be considered in analyses of the AMP SCZ neuroimaging data, which will be the largest CHR cohort to date.Watch Dr. Harms discuss this article at https://vimeo.com/1059777228?share=copy#t=0 .(c) 2025.

    "text": "Abstract:\nBrain morphology differs markedly between individuals with schizophrenia, but the cellular and genetic basis of this heterogeneity is poorly understood. Here, we sought to determine whether cortical thickness (CTh) heterogeneity in schizophrenia relates to interregional variation in distinct neural cell types, as inferred from established gene expression data and person-specific genomic variation. This study comprised 1849 participants in total, including a discovery (140 cases and 1267 controls) and a validation cohort (335 cases and 185 controls). To characterize CTh heterogeneity, normative ranges were established for 34 cortical regions and the extent of deviation from these ranges was measured for each individual with schizophrenia. CTh deviations were explained by interregional gene expression levels of five out of seven neural cell types examined: (1) astrocytes; (2) endothelial cells; (3) oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs); (4) excitatory neurons; and (5) inhibitory neurons. Regional alignment between CTh alterations with cell type transcriptional maps distinguished broad patient subtypes, which were validated against genomic data drawn from the same individuals. In a predominantly neuronal/endothelial subtype (22% of patients), CTh deviations covaried with polygenic risk for schizophrenia (sczPRS) calculated specifically from genes marking neuronal and endothelial cells (r = -0.40, p = 0.010). Whereas, in a predominantly glia/OPC subtype (43% of patients), CTh deviations covaried with sczPRS calculated from glia and OPC-linked genes (r = -0.30, p = 0.028). This multi-scale analysis of genomic, transcriptomic, and brain phenotypic data may indicate that CTh heterogeneity in schizophrenia relates to inter-individual variation in cell-type specific functions. Decomposing heterogeneity in relation to cortical cell types enables prioritization of schizophrenia subsets for future disease modeling efforts.(c) 2022. The Author(s)."

    "text": "Abstract:\nBACKGROUND: The time following a recent onset of psychosis is a critical period during which intervention may be maximally effective. Studying individuals in this period also offers an opportunity to investigate putative brain biomarkers of illness prior to the long-term effects of chronicity and medication. The Human Connectome Project for Early Psychosis (HCP-EP) was funded by the National Institutes of Mental Health (NIMH) as an extension of the original Human Connectome Project’s approach to understanding the human brain and its structural and functional connections.\nDESIGN: The HCP-EP data were collected at 3 sites in Massachusetts (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, McLean Hospital, and Massachusetts General Hospital), and one site in Indiana (Indiana University). Brigham and Women’s Hospital served as the data coordination center and as an imaging site.\nRESULTS: The HCP-EP dataset includes high-quality clinical, cognitive, functional, neuroimaging, and blood specimen data acquired from 303 individuals between the ages of 16-35 years old with affective psychosis (n = 75), non-affective psychosis (n = 148), and healthy controls (n = 80). Participants with early psychosis were within 5 years of illness onset (mean duration = 1.9 years, standard deviation = 1.4 years). All data and novel or modified analytic tools developed as part of the study are publicly available to the research community through the NIMH Data Archive (NDA) or GitHub (https://github.com/pnlbwh).\nCONCLUSIONS: This paper provides an overview of the specific HCP-EP procedures, assessments, and protocols, as well as a brief characterization of the study participants to make it easier for researchers to use this rich dataset. Although we focus here on discussing and comparing affective and non-affective psychosis groups, the HCP-EP dataset also provides sufficient information for investigators to group participants differently."

    "text": "Abstract:\nThe brainstem, a structure of vital importance in mammals, is currently becoming a principal focus in cognitive, affective, and clinical neuroscience. Midbrain, pontine and medullary structures serve as the conduit for signals between the forebrain and spinal cord, are the epicenter of cranial nerve-circuits and systems, and subserve such integrative functions as consciousness, emotional processing, pain, and motivation. In this study, we parcellated the nuclear masses and the principal fiber pathways that were visible in a high-resolution T2-weighted MRI dataset of 50-micron isotropic voxels of a postmortem human brainstem. Based on this analysis, we generated a detailed map of the human brainstem. To assess the validity of our maps, we compared our observations with histological maps of traditional human brainstem atlases. Given the unique capability of MRI-based morphometric analysis in generating and preserving the morphology of 3D objects from individual 2D sections, we reconstructed the motor, sensory and integrative neural systems of the brainstem and rendered them in 3D representations. We anticipate the utilization of these maps by the neuroimaging community for applications in basic neuroscience as well as in neurology, psychiatry, and neurosurgery, due to their versatile computational nature in 2D and 3D representations in a publicly available capacity.Copyright (c) 2020 Rushmore, Wilson-Braun, Papadimitriou, Ng, Rathi, Zhang, O’Donnell, Kubicki, Bouix, Yeterian, Lemaire, Calabrese, Johnson, Kikinis and Makris."

We utilized two-tensor tractography and fiber clustering to compare fractional anisotropy (FA) of each side/tract between groups. Additionally, we examined the association between FA and nonverbal (WMS-R) and verbal (WMS-R, RAVLT codification) memory performance for MTLE individuals.\nRESULTS: White matter abnormalities depended on the side and presence of HS. The left-HS demonstrated widespread abnormalities for all tracts, the right-HS showed lower FA for ipsilateral tracts and the nonlesional MTLE group did not differ from healthy individuals. Results indicate no differences in verbal/nonverbal memory performance between the groups, but trend-level associations between higher FA of visual memory and the left CB (r = 0.286, P = 0.018), verbal memory (RAVLT) and -left CB (r = 0.335, P = 0.005), -right CB (r = 0.286, P = 0.016), and -left AF (r = 0.287, P = 0.017).\nSIGNIFICANCE: Our results highlight that the presence and side of HS are crucial to understand the pathophysiology of MTLE. Specifically, left-sided HS seems to be related to widespread bilateral white matter abnormalities. Future longitudinal studies should focus on developing diagnostic and treatment strategies dependent on HS’s presence/side."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract:\nBACKGROUND: Exposure to repetitive head impacts (RHI) in American football players can lead to cognitive impairment and dementia due to neurodegenerative disease, particularly chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The pathognomonic lesion of CTE consists of perivascular aggregates of hyper-phosphorylated tau in neurons at the depths of cortical sulci. However, it is unclear whether exposure to RHI accelerates amyloid-b (Ab) plaque formation and increases the risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Although the Ab neuritic plaques characteristic of AD are observed in a minority of later-stage CTE cases, diffuse plaques are more common. This study examined whether former professional and college American football players, including those with cognitive impairment and dementia, have elevated neuritic Ab plaque density, as measured by florbetapir PET. Regardless of cognitive and functional status, elevated levels of florbetapir uptake were not expected.\nMETHODS: We examined 237 men ages 45-74, including 119 former professional (PRO) and 60 former college (COL) football players, with and without cognitive impairment and dementia, and 58 same-age men without a history of contact sports or TBI (unexposed; UE) and who denied cognitive or behavioral symptoms at telephone screening. Former players were categorized into four diagnostic groups: normal cognition, subjective memory impairment, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia. Positive florbetapir PET was defined by cortical-cerebellar average SUVR of &gt;= 1.10. Multivariable linear regression and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) compared florbetapir average SUVR across diagnostic and exposure groups. Multivariable logistic regression compared florbetapir positivity. Race, education, age, and APOE4 were covariates.\nRESULTS: There were no diagnostic group differences either in florbetapir average SUVR or the proportion of elevated florbetapir uptake. Average SUVR means also did not differ between exposure groups: PRO-COL (p = 0.94, 95% C.I. = [- 0.033, 0.025]), PRO-UE (p = 0.40, 95% C.I. = [- 0.010, 0.029]), COL-UE (p = 0.36, 95% CI = [0.0004, 0.039]). Florbetapir was not significantly associated with years of football exposure, cognition, or daily functioning.\nCONCLUSIONS: Cognitive impairment in former American football players is not associated with PET imaging of neuritic Ab plaque deposition. These findings are inconsistent with a neuropathological diagnosis of AD in individuals with substantial RHI exposure and have both clinical and medico-legal implications.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02798185."

Accumulation of toxic proteins due to impaired brain clearance is suspected to play a role.\nOBJECTIVE: To investigate whether perivascular space (PVS) volume is associated with lifetime exposure to RHI in individuals at risk for RHI-associated neurodegeneration.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study was part of the Diagnostics, Imaging, and Genetics Network for the Objective Study and Evaluation of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (DIAGNOSE CTE) Research Project, a 7-year multicenter study consisting of 4 US study sites. Data were collected from September 2016 to February 2020 and analyses were performed between May 2021 and October 2023. After controlling for magnetic resonance image (MRI) and processing quality, former American football players and unexposed asymptomatic control participants were included in analyses.\nEXPOSURE: Prior exposure to RHI while participating in American football was estimated using the 3 cumulative head impact indices (CHII-G, linear acceleration; CHII-R, rotational acceleration; and CHII, number of head impacts).\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Individual PVS volume was calculated in the white matter of structural MRI. Cognitive impairment was based on neuropsychological assessment. Linear regression models were used to assess associations of PVS volume with neuropsychological assessments in former American football players. All analyses were adjusted for confounders associated with PVS volume.\nRESULTS: Analyses included 224 participants (median [IQR] age, 57 [51-65] years), with 170 male former football players (114 former professional athletes, 56 former collegiate athletes) and 54 male unexposed control participants. Former football players had larger PVS volume compared with the unexposed group (mean difference, 0.28 [95% CI, 0.00-0.56]; P = .05). Within the football group, PVS volume was associated with higher CHII-R (b = 2.71 x 10-8 [95% CI, 0.50 x 10-8 to 4.93 x 10-8]; P = .03) and CHII-G (b = 2.24 x 10-6 [95% CI, 0.35 x 10-6 to 4.13 x 10-6]; P = .03). Larger PVS volume was also associated with worse performance on cognitive functioning in former American football players (b = -0.74 [95% CI, -1.35 to -0.13]; P = .04).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that impaired perivascular brain clearance, as indicated by larger PVS volume, may contribute to the association observed between RHI exposure and neurodegeneration."

Digital phenotyping offers a novel approach to explore the nature of CHR and may help to improve personalized risk prediction. Specifically, digital data enable detailed mapping of experiences, moods and behaviors during longer periods of time (e.g., weeks, months) and offer more insight into patterns over time at the individual level across their routine daily life. However, while novel digital health technologies open up many new avenues of research, they also come with specific challenges, including replicability of results and the adherence of participants. This paper outlines the design of the digital component of the Accelerating Medicines Partnership(r) Schizophrenia Program (AMP SCZ) project, a large international collaborative project that follows individuals at CHR for psychosis over a period of two years. The digital component comprises one-year smartphone-based digital phenotyping and actigraphy. Smartphone-based digital phenotyping includes 30-item short daily self-report surveys and voice diaries as well as passive data capture (geolocation, on/off screen state, and accelerometer). Actigraphy data are collected via an Axivity wristwatch. The aim of this paper is to describe the design and the three goals of the digital measures used in AMP SCZ to: (i) better understand the symptoms, real-life experiences, and behaviors of those at CHR for psychosis, (ii) improve the prediction of transition to psychosis and other health outcomes in this population based on digital phenotyping and, (iii) serve as an example for replicable and ethical research across geographically diverse regions and cultures. Accordingly, we describe the rationale, protocol and implementation of these digital components of the AMP SCZ project. **Link to video interview: https://vimeo.com/1060935583 *.(c) 2025.

WMH might have unique characteristics in the context of RHI beyond vascular risk and normal aging processes. We evaluated biological correlates of WMH in former American football players, including markers of amyloid, tau, inflammation, axonal injury, neurodegeneration, and vascular health.\nMETHODS: Participants underwent clinical interviews, MRI, and lumbar puncture as part of the Diagnostics, Imaging, and Genetics Network for the Objective Study and Evaluation of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy Research Project. Structural equation modeling tested direct and indirect effects between log-transformed total fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) lesion volumes (TLV) and the revised Framingham stroke risk profile (rFSRP), MRI-derived global metrics of cortical thickness and fractional anisotropy (FA), and CSF levels of amyloid b1-42, p-tau181, soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2), and neurofilament light. Covariates included age, race, education, body mass index, APOE e4 carrier status, and evaluation site. Models were performed separately for former football players and a control group of asymptomatic men unexposed to RHI.\nRESULTS: In 180 former football players (mean age = 57.2, 36% Black), higher log(TLV) had direct associations with the following: higher rFSRP score (B = 0.26, 95% CI 0.07-0.40), higher p-tau181 (B = 0.17, 95% CI 0.01-0.43), lower FA (B = -0.28, 95% CI -0.42 to -0.13), and reduced cortical thickness (B = -0.25, 95% CI -0.45 to -0.08). In 60 asymptomatic unexposed men (mean age = 59.3, 40% Black), there were no direct effects on log(TLV) (rFSRP: B = -0.03, 95% CI -0.48 to 0.57; p-tau181: B = -0.30, 95% CI -1.14 to 0.37; FA: B = -0.07, 95% CI -0.48 to 0.42; or cortical thickness: B = -0.28, 95% CI -0.64 to 0.10). The former football players showed stronger associations between log(TLV) and rFSRP (1,069% difference in estimates), p-tau181 (158%), and FA (287%) than the unexposed men.\nDISCUSSION: Risk factors and biological correlates of WMH differed between former American football players and asymptomatic unexposed men. In addition to vascular health, p-tau181 and diffusion tensor imaging indices of white matter integrity showed stronger associations with WMH in the former football players. FLAIR WMH may have specific risk factors and pathologic underpinnings in RHI-exposed individuals."

However, not all individuals exposed to RHI develop such disorders. This may be explained by the reserve hypothesis. It remains unclear if the reserve hypothesis accounts for the heterogenous symptom presentation in RHI-exposed individuals. Moreover, optimal measurement of reserve in this population is unclear and likely unique from non-athlete populations.\nOBJECTIVE: We examined the association between metrics of reserve and cognitive and neuropsychiatric functioning in 89 symptomatic former National Football League players.\nMETHODS: Individual-level proxies (e.g., education) defined reserve. We additionally quantified reserve as remaining residual variance in 1) episodic memory and 2) executive functioning performance, after accounting for demographics and brain pathology. Associations between reserve metrics and cognitive and neuropsychiatric functioning were examined.\nRESULTS: Higher reading ability was associated with better attention/information processing (b=0.25; 95% CI, 0.05-0.46), episodic memory (b=0.27; 95% CI, 0.06-0.48), semantic and phonemic fluency (b=0.24; 95% CI, 0.02-0.46; b=0.38; 95% CI, 0.17-0.59), and behavioral regulation (b=-0.26; 95% CI, -0.48, -0.03) performance. There were no effects for other individual-level proxies. Residual episodic memory variance was associated with better attention/information processing (b=0.45; 95% CI, 0.25, 0.65), executive functioning (b=0.36; 95% CI, 0.15, 0.57), and semantic fluency (b=0.38; 95% CI, 0.17, 0.59) performance.

However, it is not known whether AFE is associated with cortical thickness in American football players. Sixty-three former professional National Football League players (55.5 +- 7.7 years) with cognitive, behavioral, and mood symptoms underwent neuroimaging and neuropsychological testing. First, the association between cortical thickness and AFE was tested. Second, the relationship between clusters of decreased cortical thickness and verbal and visual memory, and composite measures of mood/behavior and attention/psychomotor speed was assessed. AFE was positively correlated with cortical thickness in the right superior frontal cortex (cluster-wise P value [CWP] = 0.0006), the left parietal cortex (CWP = 0.0003), and the occipital cortices (right: CWP = 0.0023; left: CWP = 0.0008). A positive correlation was found between cortical thickness of the right superior frontal cortex and verbal memory (R = 0.333, P = 0.019), and the right occipital cortex and visual memory (R = 0.360, P = 0.012). In conclusion, our results suggest an association between younger AFE and decreased cortical thickness, which in turn is associated with worse neuropsychological performance. Furthermore, an association between younger AFE and signs of neurodegeneration later in life in symptomatic former American football players seems likely.(c) The Author(s) 2021.

Volumes were measured for the body and temporal horns of the lateral ventricles, hippocampus and amygdala as well as total brain, cortical gray matter, white matter, and subcortical gray matter volumes. Relationships between volumes as well as correlations between volumes and cognitive and clinical measures were explored. Ratios of lateral ventricular volume to total brain volume and temporal horn volume to total brain volume were calculated. Volumetric abnormalities were lateralized to the left hemisphere. Volumes of the left temporal horn, and marginally, of the body of the left lateral ventricle were larger, while left amygdala but not hippocampal volume was significantly smaller in CHR participants compared to controls. Total brain volume was also significantly smaller and the ratio of the temporal horn/total brain volume was significantly higher in CHR than in controls. White matter volume correlated positively with higher verbal fluency score while temporal horn volume correlated positively with a greater number of perseverative errors. Together with the finding of larger temporal horns and smaller amygdala volumes in the left hemisphere, these results indicate that the ratio of temporal horns volume to brain volume is abnormal in CHR compared to controls. These abnormalities present in CHR individuals may constitute the biological basis for at least some of the CHR syndrome."

Little is known about SA in those who played contact sports and are at increased risk of neurodegenerative disease(s) and other neuropathologies associated with repetitive head impacts (RHI). In this study, we investigated the frequency of diagnosed and witnessed SA and its contribution to clinical symptoms and tau pathology using PET imaging among male former college and former professional American football players.\nMETHODS: The sample included 120 former National Football League (NFL) players, 60 former college players, and 60 asymptomatic men without exposure to RHI (i.e., controls). Diagnosed SA was self-reported, and all participants completed the Mayo Sleep Questionnaire (MSQ, informant version), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), neuropsychological testing, and tau (flortaucipir) PET imaging. Associations between sleep indices (diagnosed SA, MSQ items, and the ESS) and derived neuropsychological factor scores, self-reported depression (Beck Depression Inventory-II [BDI-II]), informant-reported neurobehavioral dysregulation (Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult Version [BRIEF-A] Behavioral Regulation Index [BRI]), and tau PET uptake, were tested.\nRESULTS: Approximately 36.7% of NFL players had diagnosed SA compared with 30% of the former college football players and 16.7% of the controls. Former NFL players and college football players also had higher ESS scores compared with the controls. Years of football play was not associated with any of the sleep metrics. Among the former NFL players, diagnosed SA was associated with worse Executive Function and Psychomotor Speed factor scores, greater BDI-II scores, and higher flortaucipir PET standard uptake value ratios, independent of age, race, body mass index, and APOE e4 gene carrier status. Higher ESS scores correlated with higher BDI-II and BRIEF-A BRI scores. Continuous positive airway pressure use mitigated all of the abovementioned associations. Among the former college football players, witnessed apnea and higher ESS scores were associated with higher BRIEF-A BRI and BDI-II scores, respectively. No other associations were observed in this subgroup.\nDISCUSSION: Former elite American football players are at risk of SA. Our findings suggest that SA might contribute to cognitive, neuropsychiatric, and tau outcomes in this population. Like all neurodegenerative diseases, this study emphasizes the multifactorial contributions to negative brain health outcomes and the importance of sleep for optimal brain health."

These studies have typically used the conventional measure of fractional anisotropy, which can be contaminated by extracellular free-water. A recent free-water imaging study reported reduced free-water corrected fractional anisotropy (FAT) in chronic schizophrenia across several brain regions, but limited changes in the extracellular volume. The present study set out to validate these findings in a substantially larger sample. Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) was performed in 188 healthy controls and 281 chronic schizophrenia patients. Forty-two regions of interest (ROIs), as well as average whole-brain FAT and FW were extracted from free-water corrected diffusion tensor maps. Compared to healthy controls, reduced FAT was found in the chronic schizophrenia group in the anterior limb of the internal capsule bilaterally, the posterior thalamic radiation bilaterally, as well as the genu and body of the corpus callosum. While a significant main effect of group was observed for FW, none of the follow-up contrasts survived correction for multiple comparisons. The observed FAT reductions in the absence of extracellular FW changes, in a large, multi-site sample of chronic schizophrenia patients, validate the pattern of findings reported by a previous, smaller free-water imaging study of a similar sample. The limited number of regions in which FAT was reduced in the schizophrenia group suggests that actual white matter tissue degeneration in chronic schizophrenia, independent of extracellular FW, might be more localized than suggested previously.Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We compared sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, PSQI) between groups using ANCOVAs and calculated regression and mediation models to assess associations between PTSD, mTBI, sleep quality, and WM. Veterans with PTSD and comorbid PTSD+mTBI reported poorer sleep quality than those with mTBI or no history of PTSD or mTBI (p = 0.012 to &lt;0.001). Poor sleep quality was associated with abnormal WM microstructure in veterans with comorbid PTSD+mTBI (p &lt; 0.001). Most importantly, poor sleep quality fully mediated the association between greater PTSD symptom severity and impaired WM microstructure (p &lt; 0.001). Our findings highlight the significant impact of sleep disturbances on brain health in veterans with PTSD+mTBI, calling for sleep-targeted interventions."

    "text": "Abstract:\nIMPORTANCE: Military service members returning from theaters of war are at increased risk for mental illness, but despite high prevalence and substantial individual and societal burden, the underlying pathomechanisms remain largely unknown. Exposure to high levels of emotional stress in theaters of war and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) are presumed factors associated with risk for the development of mental disorders.\nOBJECTIVE: To investigate (1) whether war zone-related stress is associated with microstructural alterations in limbic gray matter (GM) independent of mental disorders common in this population, (2) whether associations between war zone-related stress and limbic GM microstructure are modulated by a history of mTBI, and (3) whether alterations in limbic GM microstructure are associated with neuropsychological functioning.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study was part of the TRACTS (Translational Research Center for TBI and Stress Disorders) study, which took place in 2010 to 2014 at the Veterans Affair Rehabilitation Research and Development TBI National Network Research Center. Participants included male veterans (aged 18-65 years) with available diffusion tensor imaging data enrolled in the TRACTS study. Data analysis was performed between December 2017 to September 2021.\nEXPOSURES: The Deployment Risk and Resilience Inventory (DRRI) was used to measure exposure to war zone-related stress. The Boston Assessment of TBI-Lifetime was used to assess history of mTBI. Stroop Inhibition (Stroop-IN) and Inhibition/Switching (Stroop-IS) Total Error Scaled Scores were used to assess executive or attentional control functions.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Diffusion characteristics (fractional anisotropy of tissue [FAT]) of 16 limbic and paralimbic GM regions and measures of functional outcome.\nRESULTS: Among 384 male veterans recruited, 168 (mean [SD] age, 31.4 [7.4] years) were analyzed. Greater war zone-related stress was associated with lower FAT in the cingulate (DRRI-combat left: P = .002, partial r = -0.289; DRRI-combat right: P = .02, partial r = -0.216; DRRI-aftermath left: P = .004, partial r = -0.281; DRRI-aftermath right: P = .02, partial r = -0.219), orbitofrontal (DRRI-combat left medial orbitofrontal cortex: P = .02, partial r = -0.222; DRRI-combat right medial orbitofrontal cortex: P = .005, partial r = -0.256; DRRI-aftermath left medial orbitofrontal cortex: P = .02, partial r = -0.214; DRRI-aftermath right medial orbitofrontal cortex: P = .005, partial r = -0.260; DRRI-aftermath right lateral orbitofrontal cortex: P = .03, partial r = -0.196), and parahippocampal (DRRI-aftermath right: P = .03, partial r = -0.191) gyrus, as well as with higher FAT in the amygdala-hippocampus complex (DRRI-combat: P = .005, partial r = 0.254; DRRI-aftermath: P = .02, partial r = 0.223). Lower FAT in the cingulate-orbitofrontal gyri was associated with impaired response inhibition (Stroop-IS left cingulate: P &lt; .001, partial r = -0.440; Stroop-IS right cingulate: P &lt; .001, partial r = -0.372; Stroop-IS left medial orbitofrontal cortex: P &lt; .001, partial r = -0.304; Stroop-IS right medial orbitofrontal cortex: P &lt; .001, partial r = -0.340; Stroop-IN left cingulate: P &lt; .001, partial r = -0.421; Stroop-IN right cingulate: P &lt; .001, partial r = -0.300; Stroop-IN left medial orbitofrontal cortex: P = .01, partial r = -0.223; Stroop-IN right medial orbitofrontal cortex: P &lt; .001, partial r = -0.343), whereas higher FAT in the mesial temporal regions was associated with improved short-term memory and processing speed (left amygdala-hippocampus complex: P &lt; .001, partial r = -0.574; right amygdala-hippocampus complex: P &lt; .001, partial r = 0.645; short-term memory left amygdala-hippocampus complex: P &lt; .001, partial r = 0.570; short-term memory right amygdala-hippocampus complex: P &lt; .001, partial r = 0.633). A history of mTBI did not modulate the association between war zone-related stress and GM diffusion.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study revealed an association between war zone-related stress and alteration of limbic GM microstructure, which was associated with cognitive functioning. These results suggest that altered limbic GM microstructure may underlie the deleterious outcomes of war zone-related stress on brain health. Military service members may benefit from early therapeutic interventions after deployment to a war zone."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract:\nBACKGROUND: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder that afflicts many individuals, yet the neuropathological mechanisms that contribute to this disorder remain to be fully determined. Moreover, it is unclear how exposure to mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), a condition that is often comorbid with PTSD, particularly among military personnel, affects the clinical and neurological presentation of PTSD. To address these issues, the present study explores relationships between PTSD symptom severity and the microstructure of limbic and paralimbic gray matter brain regions, as well as the impact of mTBI comorbidity on these relationships.\nMETHODS: Structural and diffusion MRI data were acquired from 102 male veterans who were diagnosed with current PTSD. Diffusion data were analyzed with free-water imaging to quantify average CSF-corrected fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) in 18 limbic and paralimbic gray matter regions. Associations between PTSD symptom severity and regional average dMRI measures were examined with repeated measures linear mixed models. Associations were studied separately in veterans with PTSD only, and in veterans with PTSD and a history of military mTBI.\nRESULTS: Analyses revealed that in the PTSD only cohort, more severe symptoms were associated with higher FA in the right amygdala-hippocampus complex, lower FA in the right cingulate cortex, and lower MD in the left medial orbitofrontal cortex. In the PTSD and mTBI cohort, more severe PTSD symptoms were associated with higher FA bilaterally in the amygdala-hippocampus complex, with higher FA bilaterally in the nucleus accumbens, with lower FA bilaterally in the cingulate cortex, and with higher MD in the right amygdala-hippocampus complex.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the microstructure of limbic and paralimbic brain regions may influence PTSD symptomatology. Further, given the additional associations observed between microstructure and symptom severity in veterans with head trauma, we speculate that mTBI may exacerbate the impact of brain microstructure on PTSD symptoms, especially within regions of the brain known to be vulnerable to chronic stress. A heightened sensitivity to the microstructural environment of the brain could partially explain why individuals with PTSD and mTBI comorbidity experience more severe symptoms and poorer illness prognoses than those without a history of brain injury. The relevance of these microstructural findings to the conceptualization of PTSD as being a disorder of stress-induced neuronal connectivity loss is discussed."

CTE cannot yet be diagnosed during life. In December 2015, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke awarded a seven-year grant (U01NS093334) to fund the “Diagnostics, Imaging, and Genetics Network for the Objective Study and Evaluation of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (DIAGNOSE CTE) Research Project.” The objectives of this multicenter project are to: develop in vivo fluid and neuroimaging biomarkers for CTE; characterize its clinical presentation; refine and validate clinical research diagnostic criteria (i.e., traumatic encephalopathy syndrome [TES]); examine repetitive head impact exposure, genetic, and other risk factors; and provide shared resources of anonymized data and biological samples to the research community. In this paper, we provide a detailed overview of the rationale, design, and methods for the DIAGNOSE CTE Research Project.\nMETHODS: The targeted sample and sample size was 240 male participants, ages 45-74, including 120 former professional football players, 60 former collegiate football players, and 60 asymptomatic participants without a history of head trauma or participation in organized contact sports. Participants were evaluated at one of four U.S. sites and underwent the following baseline procedures: neurological and neuropsychological examinations; tau and amyloid positron emission tomography; magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy; lumbar puncture; blood and saliva collection; and standardized self-report measures of neuropsychiatric, cognitive, and daily functioning. Study partners completed similar informant-report measures. Follow-up evaluations were intended to be in-person and at 3 years post-baseline. Multidisciplinary diagnostic consensus conferences are held, and the reliability and validity of TES diagnostic criteria are examined.\nRESULTS: Participant enrollment and all baseline evaluations were completed in February 2020. Three-year follow-up evaluations began in October 2019. However, in-person evaluation ceased with the COVID-19 pandemic, and resumed as remote, 4-year follow-up evaluations (including telephone-, online-, and videoconference-based cognitive, neuropsychiatric, and neurologic examinations, as well as in-home blood draw) in February 2021.\nCONCLUSIONS: Findings from the DIAGNOSE CTE Research Project should facilitate detection and diagnosis of CTE during life, and thereby accelerate research on risk factors, mechanisms, epidemiology, treatment, and prevention of CTE.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02798185."

    "text": "Abstract:\nThe cavum septum pellucidum (CSP) is a small cerebrospinal fluid-filled space found between the lateral ventricles of the forebrain that is often used as a biomarker for neurological disease and brain injury. The incidence of the CSP varies widely in different studies, with many reports finding that the CSP is frequently absent in healthy brains. Variables such as race, age and sex are typically not well-reported in CSP studies, presenting a challenge to understanding the normal distribution of the CSP in adult human brains. Moreover, the small size and frequently indistinct borders present a challenge for automated segmentation of the CSP. To address these issues, we developed a novel manual parcelation approach to volumetrically segment the CSP in high-resolution T1-weighted structural MRIs from male and female participants in the young adult dataset of the Human Connectome Project (HCP). We identified the CSP in 95.6% of subjects, compared to 57.1% when the automated segmentation approach was used on the same subjects. The CSP volume was significantly larger in male than female brains, both in terms of raw volume and volumes normalized for intracranial volume. To our knowledge, this study is the first to develop and validate a segmentation protocol for CSP volume, and to evaluate both the incidence and volume of the CSP in a representative population of young adults. Overall, these results provide a more accurate representation of the CSP in control populations, laying an improved foundation for its potential use as a biomarker for various disorders.Copyright (c) 2025 Rios, Alier, Aneja, Nimeri, Lavery, Fisher, Wiyathunge, Kubicki, Yeterian, Bouix, Makris, Arciniega and Rushmore."

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scans were acquired in 16 patients with first episode schizophrenia and 16 matched healthy controls. FA and Trace of the tracts interconnecting regions known to be rich in mirror neurons, i.e., anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), inferior parietal lobe (IPL) and premotor cortex (PMC) were evaluated. A significant group effect for Trace was observed in IPL-PMC white matter fiber tract (F (1, 28) = 7.13, p = .012), as well as in the PMC-ACC white matter fiber tract (F (1, 28) = 4.64, p = .040). There were no group differences in FA. In addition, patients with schizophrenia showed a significant positive correlation between the Trace of the left IPL-PMC white matter fiber tract, and the Ability to Feel Intimacy and Closeness score (rho = .57, p = 0.034), and a negative correlation between the Trace of the left PMC-ACC and the Relationships with Friends and Peers score (rho = remove -.54, p = 0.049). We have demonstrated disrupted white mater microstructure within the white matter tracts subserving brain regions containing mirror neurons. We further showed that such structural disruptions might impact negative symptoms and, more specifically, contribute to the inability to feel intimacy (a measure conceptually related to theory of mind) in first episode schizophrenia. Further studies are needed to understand the potential of our results for diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic interventions."

A cornerstone of the linkage between non-human primate and human studies of the brain is magnetic resonance imaging, which allows for an association to be made between the detailed structural and physiological analysis of the non-human primate and that of the human brain. To further this end, we present a novel parcellation method and system for the rhesus monkey brain, referred to as the macaque Harvard-Oxford Atlas (mHOA), which is based on the human Harvard-Oxford Atlas (HOA) and grounded in an ontological and taxonomic framework. Consistent anatomical features were used to delimit and parcellate brain regions in the macaque, which were then categorized according to functional systems. This system of parcellation will be expanded with advances in technology and, like the HOA, will provide a framework upon which the results from other experimental studies (e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), physiology, connectivity, graph theory) can be interpreted.(c) 2020.

Each person-region is characterized by a distribution of Fractional Anisotropy and comparisons are made via Median, Mean, Bhattacharya and Kullback-Liebler distances. Additionally, we examine an ordinal decision rule which compares a subject’s nth most atypical region to a healthy control’s. Ordinal comparison is motivated by mTBI’s heterogeneity; each mTBI has some set of damaged tissue which is not necessarily spatially consistent. These improvements correctly distinguish Persistent Post-Concussive Symptoms in a small dataset but achieve only a .74 AUC in identifying mTBI subjects with milder symptoms. Finally, we perform subject-specific simulations which characterize which injuries are detected and which are missed."

Psychomotor function includes both cognitive and motor components, but the neural circuits driving these subprocesses and how they relate to symptoms have remained elusive for centuries.\nMETHODS: We analyzed data from the HCP-EP (Human Connectome Project for Early Psychosis), a multisite study of 125 participants with early psychosis and 58 healthy participants with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and clinical characterization. Psychomotor function was assessed using the 9-hole pegboard task, a timed motor task that engages mechanical and psychomotor components of action, and tasks assessing processing speed and task switching. We used multivariate pattern analysis of whole-connectome data to identify brain correlates of psychomotor function.\nRESULTS: We identified discrete brain circuits driving the cognitive and motor components of psychomotor function. In our combined sample of participants with psychosis (n = 89) and healthy control participants (n = 52), the strongest correlates of psychomotor function (pegboard performance) (p &lt; .005) were between a midline cerebellar region and left frontal region and presupplementary motor area. Psychomotor function was correlated with both cerebellar-frontal connectivity (r = 0.33) and cerebellar-presupplementary motor area connectivity (r = 0.27). However, the cognitive component of psychomotor performance (task switching) was correlated only with cerebellar-frontal connectivity (r = 0.19), whereas the motor component (processing speed) was correlated only with cerebellar-presupplementary motor area connectivity (r = 0.15), suggesting distinct circuits driving unique subprocesses of psychomotor function.\nCONCLUSIONS: We identified cerebellar-cortical circuits that drive distinct subprocesses of psychomotor function. Future studies should probe relationships between cerebellar connectivity and psychomotor performance using neuromodulation."

Neuroimaging methods including diffusion magnetic resonance imaging-based free-water imaging may identify neural correlates underlying suicidal ideation and attempts in individuals with TRD.\nMETHODS: Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging data were obtained from 64 male and female participants (mean age 44.5 +- 14.2 years), including 39 patients with TRD (n = 21 and lifetime history of suicidal ideation but no attempts [SI group]; n = 18 with lifetime history of suicide attempt [SA group]), and 25 age- and sex-matched healthy control participants. Depression and suicidal ideation severity were examined using clinician-rated and self-report measures. Whole-brain neuroimaging analysis was conducted using tract-based spatial statistics via FSL to identify differences in white matter microstructure in the SI versus SA groups and in patients versus control participants.\nRESULTS: Free-water imaging revealed elevated axial diffusivity and extracellular free water in fronto-thalamo-limbic white matter tracts of the SA group compared with the SI group. In a separate comparison, patients with TRD had widespread reductions in fractional anisotropy and axial diffusivity, as well as elevated radial diffusivity compared with control participants (thresholded p &lt; .05, familywise error corrected).\nCONCLUSIONS: A unique neural signature consisting of elevated axial diffusivity and free water was identified in patients with TRD and suicide attempt history. Findings of reduced fractional anisotropy, axial diffusivity, and elevated radial diffusivity in patients versus control participants are consistent with previously published studies. Multimodal and prospective investigations are recommended to better understand biological correlates of suicide attempt in TRD."

    "text": "Abstract:\nComparative structural neuroanatomy is a cornerstone for understanding human brain structure and function. A parcellation framework that relates systematically to fundamental principles of histological organization is an essential step in generating structural comparisons between species. In the present investigation, we developed a comparative parcellation reasoning system (ComPaRe), which is a formal ontological system in human and non-human primate brains based on the cortical cytoarchitectonic mapping used for both species as detailed by Brodmann. ComPaRe provides a theoretical foundation for mapping neural systems in humans and other species using neuroimaging. Based on this approach, we revised the methodology of the original Harvard-Oxford Atlas (HOA) system of brain parcellation to produce a comparative framework for the human (hHOA) and the rhesus monkey (mHOA) brains, which we refer to as HOA2.0-ComPaRe. In addition, we used dedicated segmentation software in the publicly available 3D Slicer platform to parcellate an individual human and rhesus monkey brain. This method produces quantitative morphometric parcellations in the individual brains. Based on these parcellations we created a representative template and 3D brain atlas for the two species, each based on a single subject. Thus, HOA2.0-ComPaRe provides a theoretical foundation for mapping neural systems in humans and other species using neuroimaging, while also representing a significant revision of the original human and macaque monkey HOA parcellation schemas. The methodology and atlases presented here can be used in basic and clinical neuroimaging for morphometric (volumetric) analysis, further generation of atlases, as well as localization of function and structural lesions.Copyright (c) 2022 Rushmore, Bouix, Kubicki, Rathi, Yeterian and Makris."

    "text": "Abstract:\nA joint and integrated analysis of multi-site diffusion MRI (dMRI) datasets can dramatically increase the statistical power of neuroimaging studies and enable comparative studies pertaining to several brain disorders. However, dMRI data sets acquired on multiple scanners cannot be naively pooled for joint analysis due to scanner specific nonlinear effects as well as differences in acquisition parameters. Consequently, for joint analysis, the dMRI data has to be harmonized, which involves removing scanner-specific differences from the raw dMRI signal. In this work, we propose a dMRI harmonization method that is capable of removing scanner-specific effects, while accounting for minor differences in acquisition parameters such as b-value, spatial resolution and number of gradient directions. We validate our algorithm on dMRI data acquired from two sites: Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) with 800 healthy adolescents (ages 8-22 years) and Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) with 70 healthy subjects (ages 14-54 years). In particular, we show that gender and age-related maturation differences in different age groups are preserved after harmonization, as measured using effect sizes (small, medium and large), irrespective of the test sample size. Since we use matched control subjects from different scanners to estimate scanner-specific effects, our goal in this work is also to determine the minimum number of well-matched subjects needed from each site to achieve best harmonization results. Our results indicate that at-least 16 to 18 well-matched healthy controls from each site are needed to reliably capture scanner related differences. The proposed method can thus be used for retrospective harmonization of raw dMRI data across sites despite differences in acquisition parameters, while preserving inter-subject anatomical variability.Copyright (c) 2018.

    "text": "Abstract:\nBACKGROUND: Military veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) commonly experience posttraumatic guilt. Guilt over commission or omission evolves when responsibility is assumed for an unfortunate outcome (e.g., the death of a fellow combatant). Survivor guilt is a state of intense emotional distress experienced by the weight of knowing that one survived while others did not.\nMETHODS: This study of the Translational Research Center for TBI and Stress Disorders (TRACTS) analyzed structural and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data from 132 male Iraq/Afghanistan veterans with PTSD. The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-IV (CAPS-IV) was employed to classify guilt. Thirty (22.7 %) veterans experienced guilt over acts of commission or omission, 34 (25.8 %) experienced survivor guilt, and 68 (51.5 %) had no posttraumatic guilt. White matter microstructure (fractional anisotropy, FA), cortical thickness, and cortical volume were compared between veterans with guilt over acts of commission or omission, veterans with survivor guilt, and veterans without guilt.\nRESULTS: Veterans with survivor guilt had significantly lower white matter FA compared to veterans who did not experience guilt (p &lt; .001), affecting several regions of major white matter fiber bundles. There were no significant differences in white matter FA, cortical thickness, or volumes between veterans with guilt over acts of commission or omission and veterans without guilt (p &gt; .050).\nLIMITATIONS: This cross-sectional study with exclusively male veterans precludes inferences of causality between the studied variables and generalizability to the larger veteran population that includes women.\nCONCLUSION: Survivor guilt may be a particularly impactful form of posttraumatic guilt that requires specific treatment efforts targeting brain health."

    "text": "Abstract:\nBACKGROUND: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) are common in Veterans and linked to behavioral disturbances, increased risk of cognitive decline, and Alzheimer’s disease.\nOBJECTIVE: We studied the synergistic effects of PTSD and TBI on behavioral, cognitive, and neuroimaging measures in Vietnam war Veterans.\nMETHODS: Data were acquired at baseline and after about one-year from male Veterans categorized into: PTSD, TBI, PTSD+TBI, and Veteran controls without PTSD or TBI. We applied manual tractography to examine white matter microstructure of three fiber tracts: uncinate fasciculus (N = 91), cingulum (N = 87), and inferior longitudinal fasciculus (N = 95). ANCOVAs were used to compare Veterans’ baseline behavioral and cognitive functioning (N = 285), white matter microstructure, amyloid-b (N = 230), and tau PET (N = 120). Additional ANCOVAs examined scores’ differences from baseline to follow-up.\nRESULTS: Veterans with PTSD and PTSD+TBI, but not Veterans with TBI only, exhibited poorer behavioral and cognitive functioning at baseline than controls. The groups did not differ in baseline white matter, amyloid-b, or tau, nor in behavioral and cognitive functioning, and tau accumulation change. Progression of white matter abnormalities of the uncinate fasciculus in Veterans with PTSD compared to controls was observed; analyses in TBI and PTSD+TBI were not run due to insufficient sample size.\nCONCLUSIONS: PTSD and PTSD+TBI negatively affect behavioral and cognitive functioning, while TBI does not contribute independently. Whether progressive decline in uncinate fasciculus microstructure in Veterans with PTSD might account for cognitive decline should be further studied. Findings did not support an association between PTSD, TBI, and Alzheimer’s disease pathology based on amyloid and tau PET."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract:\nBACKGROUND: 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22q11DS) is a genetic, neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a chromosomal deletion and a distinct cognitive profile. Although abnormalities in the macrostructure of the cortex have been identified in individuals with 22q11DS, it is not known if there are additional microstructural changes in gray matter regions in this syndrome, and/or if such microstructural changes are associated with cognitive functioning.\nMETHODS: This study employed a novel diffusion MRI measure, the Heterogeneity of Fractional Anisotropy (HFA), to examine variability in the microstructural organization of the cortex in healthy young adults (N = 30) and those with 22q11DS (N = 56). Diffusion MRI, structural MRI, clinical and cognitive data were acquired.\nRESULTS: Compared to controls, individuals with 22q11DS evinced increased HFA in cortical association (p = .003, d = 0.86) and paralimbic (p &lt; .0001, d = 1.2) brain areas, whereas no significant differences were found between the two groups in primary cortical brain areas. Additionally, increased HFA of the right paralimbic area was associated with poorer performance on tests of response inhibition, i.e., the Stroop Test (rho = -0.37 p = .005) and the Gordon Diagnostic System Vigilance Commission (rho = -0.41 p = .002) in the 22q11DS group. No significant correlations were found between HFA and cognitive abilities in the healthy control group.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that cortical microstructural disorganization may be a neural correlate of response inhibition in individuals with 22q11DS. Given that the migration pattern of neural crest cells is disrupted at the time of early brain development in 22q11DS, we hypothesize that these neural alterations may be neurodevelopmental in origin, and reflect cortical dysfunction associated with cognitive deficits."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract:\nOBJECTIVE: To assess cortical thickness (CT) and surface area (SA) of frontal, temporal, and parietal brain regions in a large clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR) sample, and to identify cortical brain abnormalities in CHR who convert to psychosis and in the whole CHR sample, compared with the healthy controls (HC).\nMETHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging, clinical, and cognitive data were acquired at baseline in 92 HC, 130 non-converters, and 22 converters (conversion assessed at 1-year follow-up). CT and SA at baseline were calculated for frontal, temporal, and parietal subregions. Correlations between regions showing group differences and clinical scores and age were also obtained.\nRESULTS: CT but not SA was significantly reduced in CHR compared with HC. Two patterns of findings emerged: (1) In converters, CT was significantly reduced relative to non-converters and controls in the banks of superior temporal sulcus, Heschl’s gyrus, and pars triangularis and (2) CT in the inferior parietal and supramarginal gyrus, and at trend level in the pars opercularis, fusiform, and middle temporal gyri was significantly reduced in all high-risk individuals compared with HC. Additionally, reduced CT correlated significantly with older age in HC and in non-converters but not in converters.\nCONCLUSIONS: These results show for the first time that fronto-temporo-parietal abnormalities characterized all CHR, that is, both converters and non-converters, relative to HC, while CT abnormalities in converters relative to CHR-NC and HC were found in core auditory and language processing regions."

We examined the burden and distribution of WMH, and their association with years of play, age of first exposure, and clinical function in former American football players.\nMETHODS: A total of 149 former football players and 53 asymptomatic unexposed participants (all men, 45-74 years) completed fluid-attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging, neuropsychological testing, and self-report neuropsychiatric measures. Lesion Segmentation Toolbox estimated WMH. Analyses were performed in the total sample and stratified by age 60.\nRESULTS: In older but not younger participants, former football players had greater total, frontal, temporal, and parietal log-WMH compared to asymptomatic unexposed men. In older but not younger former football players, greater log-WMH was associated with younger age of first exposure to football and worse executive function.\nDISCUSSION: In older former football players, WMH may have unique presentations, risk factors, and etiologies.\nHIGHLIGHTS: Older but not younger former football players had greater total, frontal, temporal, and parietal lobe white matter hyperintensities (WMH) compared to same-age asymptomatic unexposed men. Younger age of first exposure to football was associated with greater WMH in older but not younger former American football players. In former football players, greater WMH was associated with worse executive function and verbal memory."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract:\nThe gray matter/white matter (GM/WM) boundary of the brain is vulnerable to shear strain associated with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). It is, however, unknown whether GM/WM microstructure is associated with long-term outcomes following mTBI. The diffusion and structural MRI data of 278 participants between 18 and 65 years of age with and without military background from the Department of Defense INTRuST study were analyzed. Fractional anisotropy (FA) was extracted at the GM/WM boundary across the brain and for each lobe. Additionally, two conventional analytic approaches were used: whole-brain deep WM FA (TBSS) and whole-brain cortical thickness (FreeSurfer). ANCOVAs were applied to assess differences between the mTBI cohort (n = 147) and the comparison cohort (n = 131). Associations between imaging features and post-concussive symptom severity, and functional and cognitive impairment were investigated using partial correlations while controlling for mental health comorbidities that are particularly common among military cohorts and were present in both the mTBI and comparison group. Findings revealed significantly lower whole-brain and lobe-specific GM/WM boundary FA (p &lt; 0.011), and deep WM FA (p = 0.001) in the mTBI cohort. Whole-brain and lobe-specific GM/WM boundary FA was significantly negatively correlated with post-concussive symptoms (p &lt; 0.039), functional (p &lt; 0.016), and cognitive impairment (p &lt; 0.049). Deep WM FA was associated with functional impairment (p = 0.002). Finally, no significant difference was observed in cortical thickness, nor between cortical thickness and outcome (p &gt; 0.05). Findings from this study suggest that microstructural alterations at the GM/WM boundary may be sensitive markers of adverse long-term outcomes following mTBI."

    "text": "Abstract:\nOBJECTIVE: To investigate how the presence/side of hippocampal sclerosis (HS) are related to the white matter structure of cingulum bundle (CB), arcuate fasciculus (AF), and inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF) in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE).\nMETHODS: We acquired diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from 86 healthy and 71 individuals with MTLE (22 righ-HS; right-HS, 34 left-HS; left-HS, and 15 nonlesional MTLE). We utilized two-tensor tractography and fiber clustering to compare fractional anisotropy (FA) of each side/tract between groups. Additionally, we examined the association between FA and nonverbal (WMS-R) and verbal (WMS-R, RAVLT codification) memory performance for MTLE individuals.\nRESULTS: White matter abnormalities depended on the side and presence of HS. The left-HS demonstrated widespread abnormalities for all tracts, the right-HS showed lower FA for ipsilateral tracts and the nonlesional MTLE group did not differ from healthy individuals. Results indicate no differences in verbal/nonverbal memory performance between the groups, but trend-level associations between higher FA of visual memory and the left CB (r = 0.286, P = 0.018), verbal memory (RAVLT) and -left CB (r = 0.335, P = 0.005), -right CB (r = 0.286, P = 0.016), and -left AF (r = 0.287, P = 0.017).\nSIGNIFICANCE: Our results highlight that the presence and side of HS are crucial to understand the pathophysiology of MTLE. Specifically, left-sided HS seems to be related to widespread bilateral white matter abnormalities. Future longitudinal studies should focus on developing diagnostic and treatment strategies dependent on HS’s presence/side."

To address this problem, we present MONAI Label, a free and open-source framework that facilitates the development of applications based on artificial intelligence (AI) models that aim at reducing the time required to annotate radiology datasets. Through MONAI Label, researchers can develop AI annotation applications focusing on their domain of expertise. It allows researchers to readily deploy their apps as services, which can be made available to clinicians via their preferred user interface. Currently, MONAI Label readily supports locally installed (3D Slicer) and web-based (OHIF) frontends and offers two active learning strategies to facilitate and speed up the training of segmentation algorithms. MONAI Label allows researchers to make incremental improvements to their AI-based annotation application by making them available to other researchers and clinicians alike. Additionally, MONAI Label provides sample AI-based interactive and non-interactive labeling applications, that can be used directly off the shelf, as plug-and-play to any given dataset. Significant reduced annotation times using the interactive model can be observed on two public datasets."

    "text": "Abstract of the article:\nArtifacts are a common occurrence in Diffusion MRI (dMRI) scans. Identifying and removing them is essential to ensure the accuracy and viability of any post-processing carried out on these scans. This makes quality control (QC) a crucial first step prior to any analysis of dMRI data. Several QC methods for artifact detection exist, however they suffer from problems like requiring manual intervention and the inability to generalize across different artifacts and datasets. In this paper, we propose an automated deep learning (DL) pipeline that utilizes a 3D-Densenet architecture to train a model on diffusion volumes for automatic artifact detection. Our method is validated on 9000 volumes sourced from 7 large clinical datasets spanning different acquisition protocols (with different gradient directions, high and low b-values, single-shell and multi-shell acquisitions) from multiple scanners. Additionally, they represent diverse subject demographics including age, sex and the presence or absence of pathologies. Our QC method is found to accurately generalize across this heterogenous data by correctly detecting 92% artifacts on average across our test set. This consistent performance over diverse datasets underlines the generalizability of our method, which currently is a significant barrier hindering the widespread adoption of automated QC techniques. Thus, 3D-QCNet can be integrated into diffusion pipelines to effectively automate the arduous and time-intensive process of artifact detection."

In this paper, we explore the idea of nesting basic local transformers on non-overlapping image blocks and aggregating them in a hierarchical way. We find that the block aggregation function plays a critical role in enabling cross-block non-local information communication. This observation leads us to design a simplified architecture that requires minor code changes upon the original vision transformer. The benefits of the proposed judiciously-selected design are threefold: (1) NesT converges faster and requires much less training data to achieve good generalization on both ImageNet and small datasets like CIFAR; (2) when extending our key ideas to image generation, NesT leads to a strong decoder that is 8× faster than previous transformer-based generators; and (3) we show that decoupling the feature learning and abstraction processes via this nested hierarchy in our design enables constructing a novel method (named GradCAT) for visually interpreting the learned model."

    "text": "Abstract of the article:\nBackground: Dementia can be caused by numerous different diseases that present variable clinical courses and reveal multiple patterns of brain atrophy, making its accurate early diagnosis by conventional examinative means challenging. Although highly accurate and powerful, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) currently plays only a supportive role in dementia diagnosis, largely due to the enormous volume and diversity of data it generates. AI-based software solutions/algorithms that can perform automated segmentation and volumetry analyses of MRI data are being increasingly used to address this issue. Numerous commercial and non-commercial software solutions for automated brain segmentation and volumetry exist, with FreeSurfer being the most frequently used.\nObjectives: This Review is an account of the current situation regarding the application of automated brain segmentation and volumetry to dementia diagnosis.\nMethods: We performed a PubMed search for “FreeSurfer AND Dementia” and obtained 493 results. Based on these search results, we conducted an in-depth source analysis to identify additional publications, software tools, and methods. Studies were analyzed for design, patient collective, and for statistical evaluation (mathematical methods, correlations).\nResults: In the studies identified, the main diseases and cohorts represented were Alzheimer’s disease (n = 276), mild cognitive impairment (n = 157), frontotemporal dementia (n = 34), Parkinson’s disease (n = 29), dementia with Lewy bodies (n = 20), and healthy controls (n = 356). The findings and methods of a selection of the studies identified were summarized and discussed.\nConclusion: Our evaluation showed that, while a large number of studies and software solutions are available, many diseases are underrepresented in terms of their incidence. There is therefore plenty of scope for targeted research."

We synthesize views by querying 5D coordinates along camera rays and use classic volume rendering techniques to project the output colors and densities into an image. Because volume rendering is naturally differentiable, the only input required to optimize our representation is a set of images with known camera poses. We describe how to effectively optimize neural radiance fields to render photorealistic novel views of scenes with complicated geometry and appearance, and demonstrate results that outperform prior work on neural rendering and view synthesis. View synthesis results are best viewed as videos, so we urge readers to view our supplementary video for convincing comparisons."

    "text": "Abstract of the article:\nPurpose: To introduce an unsupervised deep-learning method for fast and effective correction of susceptibility artifacts in reversed phase-encode (PE) image pairs acquired with echo planar imaging (EPI).\nMethods: Recent learning-based correction approaches in EPI estimate a displacement field, unwarp the reversed-PE image pair with the estimated field, and average the unwarped pair to yield a corrected image. Unsupervised learning in these unwarping-based methods is commonly attained via a similarity constraint between the unwarped images in reversed-PE directions, neglecting consistency to the acquired EPI images. This work introduces a novel unsupervised deep Forward-Distortion Network (FD-Net) that predicts both the susceptibility-induced displacement field and the underlying anatomically correct image. Unlike previous methods, FD-Net enforces the forward-distortions of the correct image in both PE directions to be consistent with the acquired reversed-PE image pair. FD-Net further leverages a multiresolution architecture to maintain high local and global performance.\nResults: FD-Net performs competitively with a gold-standard reference method (TOPUP) in image quality, while enabling a leap in computational efficiency. Furthermore, FD-Net outperforms recent unwarping-based methods for unsupervised correction in terms of both image and field quality.\nConclusion: The unsupervised FD-Net method introduces a deep forward-distortion approach to enable fast, high-fidelity correction of susceptibility artifacts in EPI by maintaining consistency to measured data. Therefore, it holds great promise for improving the anatomical accuracy of EPI imaging."

This review offers hands-on guidelines for clinical developmental sMRI.

Next, we discuss challenges and good scientific practices in study design, image acquisition and analysis, and recent options to implement quality control. Finally, we discuss choices related to statistical analysis and interpretation of results.

    "text": "Abstract of the article:\nClick-based interactive image segmentation aims at extracting objects with a limited user clicking. A hierarchical backbone is the de-facto architecture for current methods. Recently, the plain, non-hierarchical Vision Transformer (ViT) has emerged as a competitive backbone for dense prediction tasks. This design allows the original ViT to be a foundation model that can be finetuned for downstream tasks without redesigning a hierarchical backbone for pretraining. Although this design is simple and has been proven effective, it has not yet been explored for interactive image segmentation. To fill this gap, we propose SimpleClick, the first interactive segmentation method that leverages a plain backbone. Based on the plain backbone, we introduce a symmetric patch embedding layer that encodes clicks into the backbone with minor modifications to the backbone itself. With the plain backbone pretrained as a masked autoencoder (MAE), SimpleClick achieves state-of-the-art performance. Remarkably, our method achieves 4.15 NoC@90 on SBD, improving 21.8% over the previous best result. Extensive evaluation on medical images demonstrates the generalizability of our method. We further develop an extremely tiny ViT backbone for SimpleClick and provide a detailed computational analysis, highlighting its suitability as a practical annotation tool."

    "text": "Abstract of the article:\nCortical surface reconstruction plays a fundamental role in modeling the rapid brain development during the perinatal period. In this work, we propose Conditional Temporal Attention Network (CoTAN), a fast end-to-end framework for diffeomorphic neonatal cortical surface reconstruction. CoTAN predicts multi-resolution stationary velocity fields (SVF) from neonatal brain magnetic resonance images (MRI). Instead of integrating multiple SVFs, CoTAN introduces attention mechanisms to learn a conditional time-varying velocity field (CTVF) by computing the weighted sum of all SVFs at each integration step. The importance of each SVF, which is estimated by learned attention maps, is conditioned on the age of the neonates and varies with the time step of integration. The proposed CTVF defines a diffeomorphic surface deformation, which reduces mesh self-intersection errors effectively. It only requires 0.21 seconds to deform an initial template mesh to cortical white matter and pial surfaces for each brain hemisphere. CoTAN is validated on the Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP) dataset with 877 3D brain MR images acquired from preterm and term born neonates. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, CoTAN achieves superior performance with only 0.12mm geometric error and 0.07% self-intersecting faces. The visualization of our attention maps illustrates that CoTAN indeed learns coarse-to-fine surface deformations automatically without intermediate supervision."

A mature medical visual question answering system (VQA) can improve diagnosis by answering clinical questions presented with a medical image. Despite its enormous potential in the healthcare industry and services, this technology is still in its infancy and is far from practical use. This paper introduces an approach based on a transformer encoder–decoder architecture. Specifically, we extract image features using the vision transformer (ViT) model, and we embed the question using a textual encoder transformer. Then, we concatenate the resulting visual and textual representations and feed them into a multi-modal decoder for generating the answer in an autoregressive way. In the experiments, we validate the proposed model on two VQA datasets for radiology images termed VQA-RAD and PathVQA. The model shows promising results compared to existing solutions. It yields closed and open accuracies of 84.99% and 72.97%, respectively, for VQA-RAD, and 83.86% and 62.37%, respectively, for PathVQA. Other metrics such as the BLUE score showing the alignment between the predicted and true answer sentences are also reported."

Existing methods for fetal brain quality assessment operate at the slice level, and fail to get a comprehensive picture of the quality of an image, that can only be achieved by looking at the entire brain volume. In this work, we propose FetMRQC, a machine learning framework for automated image quality assessment tailored to fetal brain MRI, which extracts an ensemble of quality metrics that are then used to predict experts’ ratings. Based on the manual ratings of more than 1000 low-resolution stacks acquired across two different institutions, we show that, compared with existing quality metrics, FetMRQC is able to generalize out-of-domain, while being interpretable and data efficient. We also release a novel manual quality rating tool designed to facilitate and optimize quality rating of fetal brain images.

However, these reconstructions often require many scan acquisitions, demanding a long session to use the machine and requiring the patient to remain still, with consequent possible motion artifacts. The development of neural radiance fields (NeRF) technology has shown promising results in generating highly accurate 3D reconstructions of MRI images with less user input. Our approach is based on neural radiance fields to reconstruct 3D projections from 2D slices of MRI scans. We do this by using 3D convolutional neural networks to address challenges posed by variable slice thickness; incorporating multiple MRI modalities to ensure robustness and extracting the shape and volumetric depth of both surface and internal anatomical structures with slice interpolation. This approach provides more comprehensive and robust 3D reconstructions of both surface and internal anatomical structures and has significant potential for clinical applications, allowing medical professionals to better visualize and analyze anatomical structures with less available data, potentially reducing times and motion-related issues."

Existing segmentation-based methods separate the surface registration from the surface extraction, which is computationally inefficient and prone to distortions. We introduce Vox2Cortex-Flow (V2C-Flow), a deep mesh-deformation technique that learns a deformation field from a brain template to the cortical surfaces of an MRI scan. To this end, we present a geometric neural network that models the deformation-describing ordinary differential equation in a continuous manner. The network architecture comprises convolutional and graph-convolutional layers, which allows it to work with images and meshes at the same time. V2C-Flow is not only very fast, requiring less than two seconds to infer all four cortical surfaces, but also establishes vertex-wise correspondences to the template during reconstruction. In addition, V2C-Flow is the first approach for cortex reconstruction that models white matter and pial surfaces jointly, therefore avoiding intersections between them. Our comprehensive experiments on internal and external test data demonstrate that V2C-Flow results in cortical surfaces that are state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy. Moreover, we show that the established correspondences are more consistent than in FreeSurfer and that they can directly be utilized for cortex parcellation and group analyses of cortical thickness."

    "text": "Abstract of the article:\nLinear registration to stereotaxic space is a common first step in many automated image-processing tools for analysis of human brain MRI scans. This step is crucial for the success of the subsequent image-processing steps. Several well-established algorithms are commonly used in the field of neuroimaging for this task, but none have a 100% success rate. Manual assessment of the registration is commonly used as part of quality control. To reduce the burden of this time-consuming step, we propose Deep Automated Registration Qc (DARQ), a fully automatic quality control method based on deep learning that can replace the human rater and accurately perform quality control assessment for stereotaxic registration of T1w brain scans. In a recently published study from our group comparing linear registration methods, we used a database of 9325 MRI scans and 64476 registrations from several publicly available datasets and applied seven linear registration tools to them. In this study, the resulting images that were assessed and labeled by a human rater are used to train a deep neural network to detect cases when registration failed. We further validated the results on an independent dataset of patients with multiple sclerosis, with manual QC labels available (n=1200). In terms of agreement with a manual rater, our automated QC method was able to achieve 89% accuracy and 85% true negative rate (equivalently 15% false positive rate) in detecting scans that should pass quality control in a balanced cross-validation experiments, and 96.1% accuracy and 95.5% true negative rate (or 4.5% FPR) when evaluated in a balanced independent sample, similar to manual QC rater (test-retest accuracy of 93%). The results show that DARQ is robust, fast, accurate, and generalizable in detecting failure in linear stereotaxic registrations and can substantially reduce QC time (by a factor of 20 or more) when processing large datasets."

    "text": "Abstract of the article:\nRecent years have seen increasing use of supervised learning methods for segmentation tasks. However, the predictive performance of these algorithms depends on the quality of labels. This problem is particularly pertinent in the medical image domain, where both the annotation cost and inter-observer variability are high. In a typical label acquisition process, different human experts provide their estimates of the “true” segmentation labels under the influence of their own biases and competence levels. Treating these noisy labels blindly as the ground truth limits the performance that automatic segmentation algorithms can achieve. In this work, we present a method for jointly learning, from purely noisy observations alone, the reliability of individual annotators and the true segmentation label distributions, using two coupled CNNs. The separation of the two is achieved by encouraging the estimated annotators to be maximally unreliable while achieving high fidelity with the noisy training data. We first define a toy segmentation dataset based on MNIST and study the properties of the proposed algorithm. We then demonstrate the utility of the method on three public medical imaging segmentation datasets with simulated (when necessary) and real diverse annotations: 1) MSLSC (multiple-sclerosis lesions); 2) BraTS (brain tumours); 3) LIDC-IDRI (lung abnormalities). In all cases, our method outperforms competing methods and relevant baselines particularly in cases where the number of annotations is small and the amount of disagreement is large. The experiments also show strong ability to capture the complex spatial characteristics of annotators’ mistakes."

State-of-the art susceptibility correction (for example, FSL’s TOPUP algorithm) typically requires data acquired twice with reverse phase encoding directions, referred to as blip-up blip-down acquisitions, in order to estimate an undistorted volume. Unfortunately, not all imaging protocols include a blip-up blip-down acquisition, and cannot take advantage of the state-of-the art susceptibility and motion correction capabilities. In this study, we aim to enable TOPUP-like processing with historical and/or limited diffusion imaging data that include only a structural image and single blip diffusion image. We utilize deep learning to synthesize an undistorted non-diffusion weighted image from the structural image, and use the non-distorted synthetic image as an anatomical target for distortion correction. We evaluate the efficacy of this approach (named Synb0-DisCo) and show that our distortion correction process results in better matching of the geometry of undistorted anatomical images, reduces variation in diffusion modeling, and is practically equivalent to having both blip-up and blip-down non-diffusion weighted images."

In this approach, multiple expert-segmented example images, called atlases, are registered to a target image, and deformed atlas segmentations are combined using label fusion. Among the proposed label fusion strategies, weighted voting with spatially varying weight distributions derived from atlas-target intensity similarity have been particularly successful. However, one limitation of these strategies is that the weights are computed independently for each atlas, without taking into account the fact that different atlases may produce similar label errors. To address this limitation, we propose a new solution for the label fusion problem in which weighted voting is formulated in terms of minimizing the total expectation of labeling error and in which pairwise dependency between atlases is explicitly modeled as the joint probability of two atlases making a segmentation error at a voxel. This probability is approximated using intensity similarity between a pair of atlases and the target image in the neighborhood of each voxel. We validate our method in two medical image segmentation problems: hippocampus segmentation and hippocampus subfield segmentation in magnetic resonance (MR) images. For both problems, we show consistent and significant improvement over label fusion strategies that assign atlas weights independently."

Our experiments show that the T-Loss outperforms traditional loss functions in terms of dice scores on two public medical datasets for skin lesion and lung segmentation.

Our results provide strong evidence that the T-Loss is a promising alternative for medical image segmentation where high levels of noise or outliers in the dataset are a typical phenomenon in practice.

In this work, we present a nonparametric strategy for learning invariant representations based on the recently-proposed Nadaraya-Watson (NW) head. The NW head makes a prediction by comparing the learned representations of the query to the elements of a support set that consists of labeled data. We demonstrate that by manipulating the support set, one can encode different causal assumptions. In particular, restricting the support set to a single environment encourages the model to learn invariant features that do not depend on the environment. We present a causally-motivated setup for our modeling and training strategy and validate on three challenging real-world domain generalization tasks in computer vision."

Improved understanding of fetal brain development trajectories may aid in identifying and clinically managing at-risk fetuses. Currently, fetal brain structures in magnetic resonance images (MRI) are often manually segmented, which requires both time and expertise. To facilitate the targeting and measurement of brain structures in the fetus, we compared the results of five segmentation methods applied to fetal brain MRI data to gold-standard manual tracings.\nMethods: Adult women with singleton pregnancies (n = 21), of whom five were scanned twice, approximately 3 weeks apart, were recruited [26 total datasets, median gestational age (GA) = 34.8, IQR = 30.9-36.6]. T2-weighted single-shot fast spin echo images of the fetal brain were acquired on 1.5T and 3T MRI scanners. Images were first combined into a single 3D anatomical volume. Next, a trained tracer manually segmented the thalamus, cerebellum, and total cerebral volumes. The manual segmentations were compared with five automatic methods of segmentation available within Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) and FMRIB’s Linear Image Registration Tool (FLIRT) toolboxes. The manual and automatic labels were compared using Dice similarity coefficients (DSCs). The DSC values were compared using Friedman’s test for repeated measures.\nResults: Comparing cerebellum and thalamus masks against the manually segmented masks, the median DSC values for ANTs and FLIRT were 0.72 [interquartile range (IQR) = 0.6-0.8] and 0.54 (IQR = 0.4-0.6), respectively. A Friedman’s test indicated that the ANTs registration methods, primarily nonlinear methods, performed better than FLIRT (p &lt; 0.001).\nConclusion: Deformable registration methods provided the most accurate results relative to manual segmentation. Overall, this semi-automatic subcortical segmentation method provides reliable performance to segment subcortical volumes in fetal MR images. This method reduces the costs of manual segmentation, facilitating the measurement of typical and atypical fetal brain development."

    "text": "Abstract of the article:\nPurpose: In echo-planar diffusion-weighted imaging, correcting for susceptibility-induced artifacts typically requires acquiring pairs of images, known as blip-up blip-down acquisitions, to create an undistorted volume as a target to correct distortions that are often focal where regions with differences in magnetic susceptibility interface, such as the frontal and temporal areas. However, blip-up blip-down acquisitions are not always available, and distortion effects may not be specifically localized to such areas, with subtle effects potentially extending throughout the brain. Here, we apply a deep learning technique to generate an undistorted volume to correct susceptibility-induced artifacts and demonstrate implications for image fidelity and diffusion-based inference outside of areas where high focal distortion is present.\nMethods: To demonstrate differences due to susceptibility artifact correction, uncorrected baseline images were compared to identical images where correction was performed using an undistorted target volume produced by the deep learning tool “PreQual”. Widespread geometric distortion was assessed visually by referencing diffusion-weighted images to T1-weighted images. Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) were utilized to perform whole brain analysis of fractional anisotropy (FA) values to assess differences between subject groups (depressed vs. non-depressed) via permutation-based, voxel-wise testing. Multivariate regression models were then used to contrast TBSS results between corrected and non-corrected diffusion images.\nResults: Susceptibility artifact correction resulted in visible, widespread improvement in image fidelity when referenced to T1-weighted images. TBSS results were dependent on susceptibility artifact correction with correction resulting in widespread structural alterations of the mean FA skeleton, changes in skeletal FA, and additional positive tests of significance of regression coefficients in subsequent regression models.\nConclusion: Our results indicated that EPI distortion effects are not purely focal, and that reducing distortion can result in significant differences in the interpretation of diffusion data, even in areas remote from high distortion."

Nevertheless, training high-performing models require large amounts of pixel-level ground truth masks, which can be prohibitive to obtain in the medical domain. Furthermore, training such models in a low-data regime highly increases the risk of overfitting. Recent attempts to alleviate the need for large annotated datasets have developed training strategies under the few-shot learning paradigm, which addresses this shortcoming by learning a novel class from only a few labeled examples. In this context, a segmentation model is trained on episodes, which represent different segmentation problems, each of them trained with a very small labeled dataset. In this work, we propose a novel few-shot learning framework for semantic segmentation, where unlabeled images are also made available at each episode. To handle this new learning paradigm, we propose to include surrogate tasks that can leverage very powerful supervisory signals –derived from the data itself– for semantic feature learning. We show that including unlabeled surrogate tasks in the episodic training leads to more powerful feature representations, which ultimately results in better generability to unseen tasks. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method in the task of skin lesion segmentation in two publicly available datasets. Furthermore, our approach is general and model-agnostic, which can be combined with different deep architectures."

We employ a global-to-local localization approach using fully convolutional neural networks (FCNNs). First, a global FCNN localizes multiple landmarks through the analysis of image patches, performing regression and classification simultaneously. In regression, displacement vectors pointing from the center of image patches towards landmark locations are determined. In classification, presence of landmarks of interest in the patch is established. Global landmark locations are obtained by averaging the predicted displacement vectors, where the contribution of each displacement vector is weighted by the posterior classification probability of the patch that it is pointing from. Subsequently, for each landmark localized with global localization, local analysis is performed. Specialized FCNNs refine the global landmark locations by analyzing local sub-images in a similar manner, i.e. by performing regression and classification simultaneously and combining the results. Evaluation was performed through localization of 8 anatomical landmarks in CCTA scans, 2 landmarks in olfactory MR scans, and 19 landmarks in cephalometric X-rays. We demonstrate that the method performs similarly to a second observer and is able to localize landmarks in a diverse set of medical images, differing in image modality, image dimensionality, and anatomical coverage."

Specifically, quantifying subtle neuroanatomical changes in other, not directly affected regions of the brain is essential to assess the impact of tumors, surgery, chemo/radiotherapy, or drugtreatments. However, only a limited number of solutions addresses this important task while many standard analysis pipelines simply do not support abnormal brain images at all. In this paper, we present a method to perform sensitive neuroanatomical analysis of healthy brain regions in the presence of large lesions and cavities. Our approach called “FastSurfer Lesion Inpainting Tool” (FastSurfer-LIT) leverages the recently emerged Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) to fill lesion areas with healthy tissue that matches and extends the surrounding tissue. This enables subsequent processing with established MRI analysis methods such as the calculation of adjusted volume and surface measurements using FastSurfer or FreeSurfer. FastSurfer-LIT significantly outperforms previously proposed solutions on a large dataset of simulated brain tumors (N=100) and synthetic multiple sclerosis lesions (N=39) with improved Dice and Hausdorff measures, and also on a highly heterogeneous dataset with lesions and cavities in a manual assessment (N=100). Finally, we demonstrate increased reliability to reproduce pre-operative cortical thickness estimates from corresponding post-operative temporo-mesial resection surgery MRIs. The method is publicly available at https://github.com/Deep-MI/LIT and will be integrated into the FastSurfer toolbox."

    "text": "Abstract of the article:\nLeading neuroimaging studies have pushed 3T MRI acquisition resolutions below 1.0 mm for improved structure definition and morphometry. Yet, only few, time-intensive automated image analysis pipelines have been validated for high-resolution (HiRes) settings. Efficient deep learning approaches, on the other hand, rarely support more than one fixed resolution (usually 1.0 mm). Furthermore, the lack of a standard submillimeter resolution as well as limited availability of diverse HiRes data with sufficient coverage of scanner, age, diseases, or genetic variance poses additional, unsolved challenges for training HiRes networks. Incorporating resolution-independence into deep learning-based segmentation, i.e., the ability to segment images at their native resolution across a range of different voxel sizes, promises to overcome these challenges, yet no such approach currently exists. We now fill this gap by introducing a Voxelsize Independent Neural Network (VINN) for resolution-independent segmentation tasks and present FastSurferVINN, which (i) establishes and implements resolution-independence for deep learning as the first method simultaneously supporting 0.7-1.0 mm whole brain segmentation, (ii) significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across resolutions, and (iii) mitigates the data imbalance problem present in HiRes datasets. Overall, internal resolution-independence mutually benefits both HiRes and 1.0 mm MRI segmentation. With our rigorously validated FastSurferVINN we distribute a rapid tool for morphometric neuroimage analysis. The VINN architecture, furthermore, represents an efficient resolution-independent segmentation method for wider application."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract of the article:\nThe emergence of attention-based transformer models has led to their extensive use in various tasks, due to their superior generalization and transfer properties. Recent research has demonstrated that such models, when prompted appropriately, are excellent for few-shot inference. However, such techniques are under-explored for dense prediction tasks like semantic segmentation. In this work, we examine the effectiveness of prompting a transformer-decoder with learned visual prompts for the generalized few-shot segmentation (GFSS) task. Our goal is to achieve strong performance not only on novel categories with limited examples, but also to retain performance on base categories. We propose an approach to learn visual prompts with limited examples. These learned visual prompts are used to prompt a multiscale transformer decoder to facilitate accurate dense predictions. Additionally, we introduce a unidirectional causal attention mechanism between the novel prompts, learned with limited examples, and the base prompts, learned with abundant data. This mechanism enriches the novel prompts without deteriorating the base class performance. Overall, this form of prompting helps us achieve state-of-the-art performance for GFSS on two different benchmark datasets: COCO-20i and Pascal-5i, without the need for test-time optimization (or transduction). Furthermore, test-time optimization leveraging unlabelled test data can be used to improve the prompts, which we refer to as transductive prompt tuning."

These large datasets have the potential to address the unreliability of underpowered neuroimaging studies, as well as open new avenues for large sample analyses, including exciting multimodal analyses. Additionally, research data are becoming increasingly more multimodal and longitudinal, with some studies acquiring, over multiple years, a wide range of data types including behavioral measures, neurocognition, neuroimaging, audio/video recordings, smartphone and wearable activity trackers data, and fluid biomarkers. The availability and richness of these datasets provides exciting opportunities in the quest to better understand brain structure and function, but also presents special challenges for researchers without significant computational expertise or resources to analyze this data.

The semi-structured interview, named Positive SYmptoms and Diagnostic Criteria for the CAARMS Harmonized with the SIPS (PSYCHS), generates CHR-P criteria and severity scores for both CAARMS and SIPS.\nCONCLUSIONS: Using the PSYCHS for CHR-P ascertainment, conversion determination, and attenuated positive symptom severity rating will help in comparing findings across studies and in meta-analyses."

    "text": "Abstract:\nThe perception of pain to noxious stimuli, also known as pain sensitivity, varies among individuals. The comprised brain structures and their white matter pathways are complex and elusive. Here, we aimed to investigate whether variation of microstructure of the medial forebrain bundle (MFB), a tract connecting the basal forebrain with the brain stem, is associated with interindividual pain sensitivity. We assessed interindividual pain sensitivity as a rating of pain intensity to heat stimuli (45, 47, and 48.9degC) in 38 healthy men (age: 27.05 +- 5.7 years). We also reconstructed the MFB using multitensor tractography from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) and calculated free-water corrected dMRI measures of fractional anisotropy (FAt ), radial diffusivity (RDt ), and axial diffusivity (ADt ). Lower ratings of interindividual pain intensity correlated with higher FAt and lower RDt of the MFB. As changes in FAt and RDt may reflect abnormalities in myelination, the results might be interpreted as that a lower pain rating is associated with higher degree of myelination of the MFB and could represent an inhibitory pathway of pain. Our results suggest that alteration of microstructure in the MFB contributes to the interindividual variation of pain perception.(c) 2020 The Authors.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract:\nDiffusion MRI (dMRI) data acquired on different scanners varies significantly in its content throughout the brain even if the acquisition parameters are nearly identical. Thus, proper harmonization of such data sets is necessary to increase the sample size and thereby the statistical power of neuroimaging studies. In this paper, we present a novel approach to harmonize dMRI data (the raw signal, instead of dMRI derived measures such as fractional anisotropy) using rotation invariant spherical harmonic (RISH) features embedded within a multi-modal image registration framework. All dMRI data sets from all sites are registered to a common template and voxel-wise differences in RISH features between sites at a group level are used to harmonize the signal in a subject-specific manner. We validate our method on diffusion data acquired from seven different sites (two GE, three Philips, and two Siemens scanners) on a group of age-matched healthy subjects. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method by statistically comparing diffusion measures such as fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity and generalized fractional anisotropy across these sites before and after data harmonization. Validation was also done on a group oftest subjects, which were not used to “learn” the harmonization parameters. We also show results using TBSS before and after harmonization for independent validation of the proposed methodology. Using synthetic data, we show that any abnormality in diffusion measures due to disease is preserved during the harmonization process. Our experimental results demonstrate that, for nearly identical acquisition protocol across sites, scanner-specific differences in the signal can be removed using the proposed method in a model independent manner."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract:\nBACKGROUND: Factors of increased prevalence among individuals with Black racial identity (e.g., cardiovascular disease, CVD) may influence the association between exposure to repetitive head impacts (RHI) from American football and later-life neurological outcomes. Here, we tested the interaction between racial identity and RHI on neurobehavioral outcomes, brain volumetric measures, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) total tau (t-tau), phosphorylated tau (p-tau181), and Ab1 - 42 in symptomatic former National Football League (NFL) players.\nMETHODS: 68 symptomatic male former NFL players (ages 40-69; n = 27 Black, n = 41 White) underwent neuropsychological testing, structural MRI, and lumbar puncture. FreeSurfer derived estimated intracranial volume (eICV), gray matter volume (GMV), white matter volume (WMV), subcortical GMV, hippocampal volume, and white matter (WM) hypointensities. Multivariate generalized linear models examined the main effects of racial identity and its interaction with a cumulative head impact index (CHII) on all outcomes. Age, years of education, Wide Range Achievement Test, Fourth Edition (WRAT-4) scores, CVD risk factors, and APOEe4 were included as covariates; eICV was included for MRI models. P-values were false discovery rate adjusted.\nRESULTS: Compared to White former NFL players, Black participants were 4 years younger (p = 0.04), had lower WRAT-4 scores (mean difference = 8.03, p = 0.002), and a higher BMI (mean difference = 3.09, p = 0.01) and systolic blood pressure (mean difference = 8.15, p = 0.03). With regards to group differences on the basis of racial identity, compared to White former NFL players, Black participants had lower GMV (mean adjusted difference = 45649.00, p = 0.001), lower right hippocampal volume (mean adjusted difference = 271.96, p = 0.02), and higher p-tau181/t-tau ratio (mean adjusted difference = -0.25, p = 0.01). There was not a statistically significant association between the CHII with GMV, right hippocampal volume, or p-tau181/t-tau ratio. However, there was a statistically significant Race x CHII interaction for GMV (b = 2206.29, p = 0.001), right hippocampal volume (b = 12.07, p = 0.04), and p-tau181/t-tau ratio concentrations (b = -0.01, p = 0.004).\nCONCLUSION: Continued research on racial neurological disparities could provide insight into risk factors for long-term neurological disorders associated with American football play."

    "text": "Abstract:\nDiffusion MRI studies consistently report group differences in white matter between individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia and healthy controls. Nevertheless, the abnormalities found at the group-level are often not observed at the individual level. Among the different approaches aiming to study white matter abnormalities at the subject level, normative modeling analysis takes a step towards subject-level predictions by identifying affected brain locations in individual subjects based on extreme deviations from a normative range. Here, we leveraged a large harmonized diffusion MRI dataset from 512 healthy controls and 601 individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia, to study whether normative modeling can improve subject-level predictions from a binary classifier. To this aim, individual deviations from a normative model of standard (fractional anisotropy) and advanced (free-water) dMRI measures, were calculated by means of age and sex-adjusted z-scores relative to control data, in 18 white matter regions. Even though larger effect sizes are found when testing for group differences in z-scores than are found with raw values (p &lt; .001), predictions based on summary z-score measures achieved low predictive power (AUC &lt; 0.63). Instead, we find that combining information from the different white matter tracts, while using multiple imaging measures simultaneously, improves prediction performance (the best predictor achieved AUC = 0.726). Our findings suggest that extreme deviations from a normative model are not optimal features for prediction. However, including the complete distribution of deviations across multiple imaging measures improves prediction, and could aid in subject-level classification.(c) 2021 The Authors.

We present a description of the participating research networks and the data processing analysis and coordination center, their processes for data harmonization across 43 sites from 13 participating countries (recruitment across North America, Australia, Europe, Asia, and South America), data flow and quality assessment processes, data analyses, and the transfer of data to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Data Archive (NDA) for use by the research community. In an expected sample of approximately 2000 CHR individuals and 640 matched healthy controls, AMP SCZ will collect clinical, environmental, and cognitive data along with multimodal biomarkers, including neuroimaging, electrophysiology, fluid biospecimens, speech and facial expression samples, novel measures derived from digital health technologies including smartphone-based daily surveys, and passive sensing as well as actigraphy. The study will investigate a range of clinical outcomes over a 2-year period, including transition to psychosis, remission or persistence of CHR status, attenuated positive symptoms, persistent negative symptoms, mood and anxiety symptoms, and psychosocial functioning. The global reach of AMP SCZ and its harmonized innovative methods promise to catalyze the development of new treatments to address critical unmet clinical and public health needs in CHR individuals.(c) The Author(s) 2024.

Both individuals with 22q11.2DS and those with schizophrenia present with social cognitive deficits, which are putatively subserved by a network of brain regions that are involved in the processing of social cognitive information. This study used two-tensor tractography to examine the white matter tracts believed to underlie the social brain network in a group of 57 young adults with 22q11.2DS compared to 30 unaffected controls.\nRESULTS: Results indicated that relative to controls, participants with 22q11.2DS showed significant differences in several DTI metrics within the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, cingulum bundle, thalamo-frontal tract, and inferior longitudinal fasciculus. In addition, participants with 22q11.2DS showed significant differences in scores on measures of social cognition, including the Social Responsiveness Scale and Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire. Further analyses among individuals with 22q11.2DS demonstrated an association between DTI metrics and positive and negative symptoms of psychosis, as well as differentiation between individuals with 22q11.2DS and overt psychosis, relative to those with positive prodromal symptoms or no psychosis.\nCONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that white matter disruption, specifically disrupted axonal coherence in the right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, may be a biomarker for social cognitive difficulties and psychosis in individuals with 22q11.2DS."

    "text": "Abstract:\nBACKGROUND: Neurocognitive impairment is a well-known phenomenon in schizophrenia that begins prior to psychosis onset. Connectome-wide association studies have inconsistently linked cognitive performance to resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. We hypothesized that a carefully selected cognitive instrument and refined population would allow identification of reliable brain-behavior associations with connectome-wide association studies. To test this hypothesis, we first identified brain-cognition correlations via a connectome-wide association study in early psychosis. We then asked, in an independent dataset, if these brain-cognition relationships would generalize to individuals who develop psychosis in the future.\nMETHODS: The Seidman Auditory Continuous Performance Task (ACPT) effectively differentiates healthy participants from those with psychosis. Our connectome-wide association study used the HCP-EP (Human Connectome Project for Early Psychosis) (n = 183) to identify links between connectivity and ACPT performance. We then analyzed data from the NAPLS2 (North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study 2) (n = 345), a multisite prospective study of individuals at risk for psychosis. We tested the connectome-wide association study-identified cognition-connectivity relationship in both individuals at risk for psychosis and control participants.\nRESULTS: Our connectome-wide association study in early-course psychosis identified robust associations between better ACPT performance and higher prefrontal-somatomotor connectivity (p &lt; .005). Prefrontal-somatomotor connectivity was also related to ACPT performance in at-risk individuals who would develop psychosis (n = 17). This finding was not observed in nonconverters (n = 196) or control participants (n = 132).\nCONCLUSIONS: This connectome-wide association study identified reproducible links between connectivity and cognition in separate samples of individuals with psychosis and at-risk individuals who would later develop psychosis. A carefully selected task and population improves the ability of connectome-wide association studies to identify reliable brain-phenotype relationships."

Here we found that people with psychotic disorders reported higher levels of all surveyed maltreatment types (e.g., physical abuse) than healthy controls, but people with psychotic disorders with AH (n = 41) reported greater CSA compared to both those without AH (n = 37; t = -2.21, p = .03) and controls (n = 37; t = -3.90, p &lt; .001). Among people with psychosis, elevated CSA was most pronounced among females with AH (sex x AH status: F = 4.91, p = .009), held controlling for diagnosis, medications, and other maltreatment (F = 3.88, p = .02), and correlated with the current severity of AH (r = .26, p = .03) but not other symptoms (p’s &gt; .16). Greater CSA among patients related to larger GMV of the left amygdala accounting for AH status, diagnosis, medications, and other maltreatment (t = 2.12, p = .04).

    "text": "Abstract:\nThe temporal pole (TP) is considered one of the major paralimbic cortical regions, and is involved in a variety of functions such as sensory perception, emotion, semantic processing, and social cognition. Based on differences in cytoarchitecture, the TP can be further subdivided into smaller regions (dorsal, ventrolateral and ventromedial), each forming key nodes of distinct functional networks. However, the brain structural connectivity profile of TP subregions is not fully clarified. Using diffusion MRI data in a set of 31 healthy subjects, we aimed to elucidate the comprehensive structural connectivity of three cytoarchitectonically distinct TP subregions. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) analysis suggested that major association fiber pathways such as the inferior longitudinal, middle longitudinal, arcuate, and uncinate fasciculi provide structural connectivity to the TP. Further analysis suggested partially overlapping yet still distinct structural connectivity patterns across the TP subregions. Specifically, the dorsal subregion is strongly connected with wide areas in the parietal lobe, the ventrolateral subregion with areas including constituents of the default-semantic network, and the ventromedial subregion with limbic and paralimbic areas. Our results suggest the involvement of the TP in a set of extensive but distinct networks of cortical regions, consistent with its functional roles.Copyright (c) 2023 Sasaki, Makris, Shenton, Savadjiev, Rathi, Eckbo, Bouix, Yeterian, Dickerson and Kubicki."

    "text": "Abstract:\nBACKGROUND: Traumatic encephalopathy syndrome (TES) is defined as the clinical manifestation of the neuropathological entity chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). A core feature of TES is neurobehavioral dysregulation (NBD), a neuropsychiatric syndrome in repetitive head impact (RHI)-exposed individuals, characterized by a poor regulation of emotions/behavior. To discover biological correlates for NBD, we investigated the association between biomarkers of inflammation (interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and NBD symptoms in former American football players and unexposed individuals.\nMETHODS: Our cohort consisted of former American football players, with (n = 104) or without (n = 76) NBD diagnosis, as well as asymptomatic unexposed individuals (n = 55) from the DIAGNOSE CTE Research Project. Specific measures for NBD were derived (i.e., explosivity, emotional dyscontrol, impulsivity, affective lability, and a total NBD score) from a factor analysis of multiple self-report neuropsychiatric measures. Analyses of covariance tested differences in biomarker concentrations between the three groups. Within former football players, multivariable linear regression models assessed relationships among log-transformed inflammatory biomarkers, proxies for RHI exposure (total years of football, cumulative head impact index), and NBD factor scores, adjusted for relevant confounding variables. Sensitivity analyses tested (1) differences in age subgroups (&lt; 60, &gt;= 60 years); (2) whether associations could be identified with plasma inflammatory biomarkers; (3) associations between neurodegeneration and NBD, using plasma neurofilament light (NfL) chain protein; and (4) associations between biomarkers and cognitive performance to explore broader clinical symptoms related to TES.\nRESULTS: CSF IL-6 was higher in former American football players with NBD diagnosis compared to players without NBD. Furthermore, elevated levels of CSF IL-6 were significantly associated with higher emotional dyscontrol, affective lability, impulsivity, and total NBD scores. In older football players, plasma NfL was associated with higher emotional dyscontrol and impulsivity, but also with worse executive function and processing speed. Proxies for RHI exposure were not significantly associated with biomarker concentrations.\nCONCLUSION: Specific NBD symptoms in former American football players may result from multiple factors, including neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Future studies need to unravel the exact link between NBD and RHI exposure, including the role of other pathophysiological pathways."

Lateral ventricles and subcortical structures are abnormal in this syndrome as well as in schizophrenia. Here, we investigated whether these structures are related in young adults with 22q11DS with and without prodromal symptoms (PS) for schizophrenia and whether abnormalities in volumes are associated with global functioning. MR images were acquired on a 3T scanner from 51 individuals with 22q11DS and 30 healthy controls (mean age: 21+-2 years). Correlations were performed to evaluate the relationship between ventricular and subcortical volumes, with Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) and Premorbid Adjustment Scale (PAS) in each group. Lateral ventricular volumes correlated negatively with subcortical volumes in individuals with 22q11DS. In individuals with 22q11DS with PS only, GAF correlated positively with volumes of the lateral ventricles and negatively with subcortical volumes. PAS correlated negatively with lateral ventricle volumes, and positively with volumes of subcortical structures. The results suggest a common neurodevelopmental mechanism related to the growth of these brain structures. Further, the ratio between the volumes and clinical measures could potentially be used to characterize individuals with 22q11DS and those from the general population for the risk of the development of schizophrenia.Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Translational evidence demonstrates the pivotal role of the amygdala in fear and anxiety. However, most of these approaches have used hypothesis-driven analyses with predefined regions of interest. A data-driven analysis may provide a complimentary, unbiased approach to identifying brain correlates of fear and anxiety. The aim of the current study was to identify the brain basis of fear and anxiety in early psychosis and controls using a data-driven approach. We analyzed data from the Human Connectome Project for Early Psychosis, a multi-site study of 125 people with psychosis and 58 controls with resting-state fMRI and clinical characterization. Multivariate pattern analysis of whole-connectome data was used to identify shared and psychosis-specific brain correlates of fear and anxiety using the NIH Toolbox Fear-Affect and Fear-Somatic Arousal scales. We then examined clinical correlations of Fear-Affect scores and connectivity patterns. Individuals with psychosis had higher levels of Fear-Affect scores than controls (p &lt; 0.05). The data-driven analysis identified a cluster encompassing the amygdala and hippocampus where connectivity was correlated with Fear-Affect score (p &lt; 0.005) in the entire sample. The strongest correlate of Fear-Affect was between this cluster and the anterior insula and stronger connectivity was associated with higher Fear-Affect scores (r = 0.31, p = 0.0003). The multivariate pattern analysis also identified a psychosis-specific correlate of Fear-Affect score between the amygdala/hippocampus cluster and a cluster in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC). Higher Fear-Affect scores were correlated with stronger amygdala/hippocampal-VMPFC connectivity in the early psychosis group (r = 0.33, p = 0.002), but not in controls (r = -0.15, p = 0.28). The current study provides evidence for the transdiagnostic role of the amygdala, hippocampus, and anterior insula in the neural basis of fear and anxiety and suggests a psychosis-specific relationship between fear and anxiety symptoms and amygdala/hippocampal-VMPFC connectivity. Our novel data-driven approach identifies novel, psychosis-specific treatment targets for fear and anxiety symptoms and provides complimentary evidence to decades of hypothesis-driven approaches examining the brain basis of threat processing.(c) 2024.

Here we aimed to investigate whether young endurance athletes and non-athletes differ in the gray and white matter of the brain and whether cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is associated with these differences. We assessed the CRF, volumes of the gray and white matter of the brain using structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), and brain white matter connections using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) in 20 young male endurance athletes and 21 healthy non-athletes. While total brain volume was similar in both groups, the white matter volume was larger and the gray matter volume was smaller in the athletes compared to non-athletes. The reduction of gray matter was located in the association areas of the brain that are specialized in processing of sensory stimuli. In the microstructure analysis, significant group differences were found only in the association tracts, for example, the inferior occipito-frontal fascicle (IOFF) showing higher fractional anisotropy and lower radial diffusivity, indicating stronger myelination in this tract. Additionally, gray and white matter brain volumes, as well as association tracts correlated with CRF. No changes were observed in other brain areas or tracts. In summary, the brain signature of the endurance athlete is characterized by changes in the integration of sensory and motor information in the association areas.(c) 2023 The Authors.

    "text": "Abstract:\nMild traumatic brain injuries (mTBIs) are often associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In cases of chronic mTBI, accurate diagnosis can be challenging due to the overlapping symptoms this condition shares with PTSD. Furthermore, mTBIs are heterogeneous and not easily observed using conventional neuroimaging tools, despite the fact that diffuse axonal injuries are the most common injury. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is sensitive to diffuse axonal injuries and is thus more likely to detect mTBIs, especially when analyses account for the inter-individual variability of these injuries. Using a subject-specific approach, we compared fractional anisotropy (FA) abnormalities between groups with a history of mTBI (n = 35), comorbid mTBI and PTSD (mTBI + PTSD; n = 22), and healthy controls (n = 37). We compared all three groups on the number of abnormal FA clusters derived from subject-specific injury profiles (i.e., individual z-score maps) along a common white matter skeleton. The mTBI + PTSD group evinced a greater number of abnormally low FA clusters relative to both the healthy controls and the mTBI group without PTSD (p &lt; .05). Across the groups with a history of mTBI, increased numbers of abnormally low FA clusters were significantly associated with PTSD symptom severity, depression, post-concussion symptoms, and reduced information processing speed (p &lt; .05). These findings highlight the utility of subject-specific microstructural analyses when searching for mTBI-related brain abnormalities, particularly in patients with PTSD. This study also suggests that patients with a history of mTBI and comorbid PTSD, relative to those without PTSD, are at increased risk of FA abnormalities."

    "text": "Abstract:\nBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Exposure to repetitive head impacts (RHI) is linked to the development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which can only be diagnosed at post-mortem. The presence of a cavum septum pellucidum (CSP) is a common finding in post-mortem studies of confirmed CTE and in neuroimaging studies of individuals exposed to RHI. This study examines CSP in living former American football players, investigating its association with RHI exposure, traumatic encephalopathy syndrome (TES) diagnosis, and provisional levels of certainty for CTE pathology.\nMETHODS: Data from the DIAGNOSE CTE Research Project were used to compare the presence and ratio of CSP in former American football players (n = 175), consisting of former college (n = 58) and former professional players (n = 117), and asymptomatic unexposed controls without RHI exposure (n = 55). We further evaluated potential associations between CSP measures and cumulative head impact index (CHII) measures (frequency, linear acceleration, and rotational force), a TES diagnosis (yes/no), and a provisional level of certainty for CTE pathology (suggestive, possible, and probable).\nRESULTS: Former American football players exhibited a higher CSP presence and ratio than unexposed asymptomatic controls. Among player subgroups, professional players showed a greater CSP ratio than former college players and unexposed asymptomatic controls. Among all football players, CHII rotational forces correlated with an increased CSP ratio. No significant associations were found between CSP measures and diagnosis of TES or provisional levels of certainty for CTE pathology.\nDISCUSSION: This study confirms previous findings, highlighting a greater prevalence of CSP and a greater CSP ratio in former American football players compared with unexposed asymptomatic controls. In addition, former professional players showed a greater CSP ratio than college players. Moreover, the relationship between estimates of CHII rotational forces and CSP measures suggests that cumulative frequency and strength of rotational forces experienced in football are associated with CSP. However, CSP does not directly correlate with TES diagnosis or provisional levels of certainty for CTE, indicating that it may be a consequence of RHI associated with rotational forces. Further research, especially longitudinal studies, is needed for confirmation and to explore changes over time."

    "text": "Abstract:\nIndividuals at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR) have variable clinical outcomes and low conversion rates, limiting development of novel and personalized treatments. Moreover, given risks of antipsychotic drugs, safer effective medications for CHR individuals are needed. The Accelerating Medicines Partnership(r) Schizophrenia (AMP(r) SCZ) Program was launched to address this need. Based on past CHR and schizophrenia studies, AMP SCZ assessed electroencephalography (EEG)-based event-related potential (ERP), event-related oscillation (ERO), and resting EEG power spectral density (PSD) measures, including mismatch negativity (MMN), auditory and visual P300 to target (P3b) and novel (P3a) stimuli, 40-Hz auditory steady state response, and resting EEG PSD for traditional frequency bands (eyes open/closed). Here, in an interim analysis of AMP SCZ EEG measures, we assess test-retest reliability and stability over sessions (baseline, month-2 follow-up) in CHR (n = 654) and community control (CON; n = 87) participants. Reliability was calculated as Generalizability (G)-coefficients, and changes over session were assessed with paired t-tests. G-coefficients were generally good to excellent in both groups (CHR: mean = 0.72, range = 0.49-0.85; CON: mean = 0.71, range = 0.44-0.89). Measure magnitudes significantly (p &lt; 0.001) decreased over session (MMN, auditory and visual target P3b, visual novel P3a, 40-Hz ASSR) and/or over runs within sessions (MMN, auditory/visual novel P3a and target P3b), consistent with habituation effects. Despite these small systematic habituation effects, test-retest reliabilities of the AMP SCZ EEG-based measures are sufficiently strong to support their use in CHR studies as potential predictors of clinical outcomes, markers of illness progression, and/or target engagement or secondary outcome measures in controlled clinical trials.(c) 2025.

Multi-shell diffusion magnetic resonance imaging data were collected across multiple timepoints (1-5 over 1 year) in 286 subjects (aged 12-32 years): 25 CHR individuals who transitioned to psychosis (CHR-P; 61 scans), 205 CHR subjects with unknown transition outcome after the 1-year follow-up period (CHR-U; 596 scans), and 56 healthy controls (195 scans). Linear mixed effects models were fitted to infer the impact of age and illness-onset on variation in the fractional anisotropy of cellular tissue (FAT) and the volume fraction of extracellular free water (FW). Baseline measures of white matter microstructure did not differentiate between HC, CHR-U and CHR-P individuals. However, age trajectories differed between the three groups in line with a developmental effect: CHR-P and CHR-U groups displayed higher FAT in adolescence, and 4% lower FAT by 30 years of age compared to controls. Furthermore, older CHR-P subjects (20+ years) displayed 4% higher FW in the forceps major (p &lt; 0.05). Prospective analysis in CHR-P did not reveal a significant impact of illness onset on regional FAT or FW, suggesting that transition to psychosis is not marked by dramatic change in white matter microstructure. Instead, clinical high risk for psychosis-regardless of transition outcome-is characterized by subtle age-related white matter changes that occur in tandem with development.(c) 2021.

We use a neural network to predict a map between a source and a target image as well as the map when swapping the source and target images. Different from existing approaches, we compose these two resulting maps and regularize deviations of the Jacobian of this composition from the identity matrix. This regularizer - GradICON - results in much better convergence when training registration models compared to promoting inverse consistency of the composition of maps directly while retaining the desirable implicit regularization effects of the latter. We achieve state-of-the-art registration performance on a variety of real-world medical image datasets using a single set of hyperparameters and a single non-dataset-specific training protocol.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract:\nINTRODUCTION: Abnormalities in the corpus callosum (CC) and the lateral ventricles (LV) are hallmark features of schizophrenia. These abnormalities have been reported in chronic and in first episode schizophrenia (FESZ). Here we explore further associations between CC and LV in FESZ using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).\nMETHODS: . Sixteen FESZ patients and 16 healthy controls (HC), matched on age, gender, and handedness participated in the study. Diffusion and structural imaging scans were acquired on a 3T GE Signa magnet. Volumetric measures for LV and DTI measures for five CC subdivisions were completed in both groups. In addition, two-tensor tractography, the latter corrected for free-water (FAt), was completed for CC. Correlations between LV and DTI measures of the CC were examined in both groups, while correlations between DTI and clinical measures were examined in only FESZ.\nRESULTS: Results from two-tensor tractography demonstrated decreased FAt and increased trace and radial diffusivity (RDt) in the five CC subdivisions in FESZ compared to HC. Central CC diffusion measures in FESZ were significantly correlated with volume of the LV, i.e., decreased FAt values were associated with larger LV volume, while increased RDt and trace values were associated with larger LV volume. In controls, correlations were also significant, but they were in the opposite direction from FESZ. In addition, decreased FAt in FESZ was associated with more positive symptoms.\nDISCUSSION: Partial volume corrected FAt, RDt, and trace abnormalities in the CC in FESZ suggest possible de- or dys-myelination, or changes in axonal diameters, all compatible with neurodevelopmental theories of schizophrenia. Correlational findings between the volume of LV and diffusion measures in FESZ reinforce the concept of a link between abnormalities in the LV and CC in early stages of schizophrenia and are also compatible with neurodevelopmental abnormalities in this population."

The Accelerating Medicines Partnership(r) Schizophrenia (AMP(r)SCZ) aims to ascertain biomarkers that both predict clinical outcomes and provide insights into the biological processes driving clinical outcomes in persons meeting CHR criteria. AMP(r)SCZ will follow almost 2000 CHR and 640 community study participants for two years, assessing biomarkers at baseline and two-month follow-up including the collection of blood and saliva samples. The following provides the rationale and methods for plans to utilize polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia and other disorders, salivary cortisol levels, and a discovery-based proteomic platform for plasma analyses. We also provide details about the standardized methods used to collect and store these biological samples, as well as the study participant metadata and quality control measures related to preanalytical factors that could influence the values of the biomarkers.

    "text": "Abstract:\nModern research management, particularly for publicly funded studies, assumes a data governance model in which grantees are considered stewards rather than owners of important data sets. Thus, there is an expectation that collected data are shared as widely as possible with the general research community. This presents problems in complex studies that involve sensitive health information. The latter requires balancing participant privacy with the needs of the research community. Here, we report on the data operation ecosystem crafted for the Accelerating Medicines Partnership(r) Schizophrenia project, an international observational study of young individuals at clinical high risk for developing a psychotic disorder. We review data capture systems, data dictionaries, organization principles, data flow, security, quality control protocols, data visualization, monitoring, and dissemination through the NIMH Data Archive platform. We focus on the interconnectedness of these steps, where our goal is to design a seamless data flow and an alignment with the FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) principles while balancing local regulatory and ethical considerations. This process-oriented approach leverages automated pipelines for data flow to enhance data quality, speed, and collaboration, underscoring the project’s contribution to advancing research practices involving multisite studies of sensitive mental health conditions. An important feature is the data’s close-to-real-time quality assessment (QA) and quality control (QC). The focus on close-to-real-time QA/QC makes it possible for a subject to redo a testing session, as well as facilitate course corrections to prevent repeating errors in future data acquisition.

This positivity bias is related to memory and attention processes and is linked to the function and structure of several interconnected brain areas. However, the relationship between the positivity bias and white matter integrity remains elusive. The present study examines how white matter organization relates to the degree of the positivity bias among older adults. We collected imaging and behavioral data from 25 individuals (12 females, 13 males, and a mean age of 77.32). Based on a functional memory task, we calculated a Pos-Neg score, reflecting the memory for positively valenced information over negative information, and a Pos-Neu score, reflecting the memory for positively valenced information over neutral information. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data were processed using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics. We performed two non-parametric permutation tests to correlate whole brain white matter integrity and the Pos-Neg and Pos-Neu scores while controlling for age, sex, and years of education. We observed a statistically significant positive association between the Pos-Neu score and white matter integrity in multiple brain connections, mostly frontal. The results did not remain significant when including verbal episodic memory as an additional covariate. Our study indicates that the positivity bias in memory in older adults is associated with more organized white matter in the connections of the frontal brain. While these frontal areas are critical for memory and executive processes and have been related to pathological aging, more extensive studies are needed to fully understand their role in the positivity bias and the potential for therapeutic interventions.(c) 2024.

    "text": "Abstract:\nPosttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) co-occurring with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is common in veterans. Worse clinical outcome in those with PTSD has been associated with decreased serum neurosteroid levels. Furthermore, decreased cortical thickness has been associated with both PTSD and mTBI. However, it is not known whether decreased neurosteroids are associated with decreased cortical thickness in PTSD co-occurring with mTBI. This study included 141 individuals divided into the following groups: (a) mTBI group (n = 32 [10 female, 22 male] veterans with a history of mTBI); (b) PTSD + mTBI group (n = 41 [6 female, 35 male] veterans with current PTSD with a history of mTBI); and (c) control group (n = 68 [35 female, 33 male] control participants), which were acquired through the Injury and Traumatic Stress (INTRuST) Clinical Consortium. Subjects underwent clinical assessment, magnetic resonance imaging at 3 T, and serum neurosteroid quantifications of allopregnanolone (ALLO) and pregnenolone (PREGN). Group differences in cortical thickness and associations between serum neurosteroid levels and cortical thickness were investigated. Cortical thickness was decreased in the PTSD + mTBI group compared with the other groups. In the PTSD + mTBI group, decreased cortical thickness was also associated with lower serum ALLO (right superior frontal cortex) and lower serum PREGN (left middle temporal and right orbitofrontal cortex). Cortical thickness in the middle temporal and orbitofrontal cortex was associated with PTSD symptom severity. There were no significant associations between neurosteroids and cortical thickness in the mTBI or control groups. Decreased cortical thickness in individuals with PTSD + mTBI is associated with decreased serum neurosteroid levels and greater PTSD symptom severity. Causality is unclear. However, future studies might investigate whether treatment with neurosteroids could counteract stress-induced neural atrophy in PTSD + mTBI by potentially preserving cortical thickness."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract:\nBACKGROUND: Intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetration is highly prevalent among veterans. Suggested risk factors of IPV perpetration include combat exposure, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, alcohol use, and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). While the underlying brain pathophysiological characteristics associated with IPV perpetration remain largely unknown, previous studies have linked aggression and violence to alterations of the limbic system. Here, we investigate whether IPV perpetration is associated with limbic microstructural abnormalities in military veterans. Further, we test the effect of potential risk factors (i.e., PTSD, depression, substance use disorder, mTBI, and war zone-related stress) on the prevalence of IPV perpetration.\nMETHODS: Structural and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) data were acquired from 49 male veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars (Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom; OEF/OIF) of the Translational Research Center for TBI and Stress Disorders (TRACTS) study. IPV perpetration was assessed using the psychological aggression and physical assault sub-scales of the Revised Conflict Tactics Scales (CTS2). Odds ratios were calculated to assess the likelihood of IPV perpetration in veterans with either of the following diagnoses: PTSD, depression, substance use disorder, or mTBI. Fractional anisotropy tissue (FA) measures were calculated for limbic gray matter structures (amygdala-hippocampus complex, cingulate, parahippocampal gyrus, entorhinal cortex). Partial correlations were calculated between IPV perpetration, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and FA.\nRESULTS: Veterans with a diagnosis of PTSD, depression, substance use disorder, or mTBI had higher odds of perpetrating IPV. Greater war zone-related stress, and symptom severity of PTSD, depression, and mTBI were significantly associated with IPV perpetration. CTS2 (psychological aggression), a measure of IPV perpetration, was associated with higher FA in the right amygdala-hippocampus complex (r = 0.400, p = 0.005).\nCONCLUSION: Veterans with psychiatric disorders and/or mTBI exhibit higher odds of engaging in IPV perpetration. Further, the more severe the symptoms of PTSD, depression, or TBI, and the greater the war zone-related stress, the greater the frequency of IPV perpetration. Moreover, we report a significant association between psychological aggression against an intimate partner and microstructural alterations in the right amygdala-hippocampus complex. These findings suggest the possibility of a structural brain correlate underlying IPV perpetration that requires further research."

We enrolled 47 patients and 23 age- and sex-matched healthy controls and resampled our data into a balanced dataset using a Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique method. We randomly permuted the classification of all participants as a patient or healthy control 100 times and ran the RF and SVM with leave one out cross validation for each permutation. We then compared the sensitivity and specificity of the original dataset and the permuted dataset.\nRESULTS: Classification using RF with 504 features showed a significantly higher rate of performance compared to classification by chance: sensitivity (87.6% vs. 47.0%) and specificity (95.9 vs. 48.4%) performed by RF, sensitivity (89.5% vs. 48.0%) and specificity (94.5% vs. 47.1%) performed by SVM.\nCONCLUSIONS: Machine learning using RF and SVM with both volume and diffusion measures can discriminate patients with schizophrenia with a high degree of performance.

Grip strength is one aspect of psychomotor function that is known to be linked to structural neural integrity and well-being. This study sought to determine whether grip strength is a marker of alterations in resting-state connectivity and well-being in psychotic disorders in order to further clarify the mechanisms by which psychosis phenomenology is related to psychomotor processes.\nMETHODS: The authors analyzed resting-state functional MRI and grip strength in 89 individuals with early psychosis and 51 control subjects without psychiatric disorders from the Human Connectome Project for Early Psychosis. Participants ranged in age from 16 to 35 years. Using multivariate pattern analysis of whole-connectome data, the authors identified brain correlates of grip strength and then replicated this analysis using the NIH Toolbox well-being measures and the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF).\nRESULTS: The psychosis group exhibited reduced grip strength, well-being, and GAF scores compared to the control group. Grip strength was linked to resting-state connectivity in the sensorimotor cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and cerebellum. Connectivity correlated with the default mode network (DMN) (rsensorimotor=0.22, rcingulate=0.30, rcerebellum=0.24). When the analysis was repeated for GAF and well-being, overlapping regions in the sensorimotor cortex and cerebellum were connected to the DMN and related to GAF (rsensorimotor=0.17, rcerebellum=0.28) and well-being (rsensorimotor=0.16, rcerebellum=0.16). Relationships were driven by the psychosis group for cerebellum and cingulate nodes.\nCONCLUSIONS: Data-driven, connectome-wide analysis identified shared brain correlates of grip strength, overall function, and well-being in a sample of young adults with psychosis and healthy control subjects. This suggests that grip strength may be a marker of DMN connectivity, which may in turn be an important marker of overall health, even in young adult populations."

Raw scores were converted to T-scores using age, sex, and education-adjusted normative data. A T-score &lt;= 35 defined impairment. A domain was impaired if 2+ scores fell in the impaired range except for the language and visuospatial domains due to the limited number of tests.\nRESULTS: Most football players had subjective cognitive concerns.

Improvements in dMRI tractography algorithms, which reconstruct macroscopic three-dimensional white matter fiber pathways, have allowed for methodological advances in the study of white matter; however, insufficient attention has been paid to comparing post-tractography methods that extract white matter fiber tracts of interest from whole-brain tractography. Here we conduct a comparison of three representative and conceptually distinct approaches to fiber tract delineation: 1) a manual multiple region of interest-based approach, 2) an atlas-based approach, and 3) a groupwise fiber clustering approach, by employing methods that exemplify these approaches to delineate the arcuate fasciculus, the middle longitudinal fasciculus, and the uncinate fasciculus in 10 healthy male subjects. We enable qualitative comparisons across methods, conduct quantitative evaluations of tract volume, tract length, mean fractional anisotropy, and true positive and true negative rates, and report measures of intra-method and inter-method agreement. We discuss methodological similarities and differences between the three approaches and the major advantages and drawbacks of each, and review research and clinical contexts for which each method may be most apposite. Emphasis is given to the means by which different white matter fiber tract delineation approaches may systematically produce variable results, despite utilizing the same input tractography and reliance on similar anatomical knowledge.Copyright (c) 2018.

    "text": "Abstract:\nExposure to repetitive head impacts in contact sports is associated with neurodegenerative disorders including chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which currently can be diagnosed only at post-mortem. American football players are at higher risk of developing CTE given their exposure to repetitive head impacts. One promising approach for diagnosing CTE in vivo is to explore known neuropathological abnormalities at post-mortem in living individuals using structural MRI. MRI brain morphometry was evaluated in 170 male former American football players ages 45-74 years (n = 114 professional; n = 56 college) and 54 same-age unexposed asymptomatic male controls (n = 54, age range 45-74). Cortical thickness and volume of regions of interest were selected based on established CTE pathology findings and were assessed using FreeSurfer. Group differences and interactions with age and exposure factors were evaluated using a generalized least squares model. A separate logistic regression and independent multinomial model were performed to predict each traumatic encephalopathy syndrome (TES) diagnosis, core clinical features and provisional level of certainty for CTE pathology using brain regions of interest. Former college and professional American football players (combined) showed significant cortical thickness and/or volume reductions compared to unexposed asymptomatic controls in the hippocampus, amygdala, entorhinal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, insula, temporal pole and superior frontal gyrus. Post hoc analyses identified group-level differences between former professional players and unexposed asymptomatic controls in the hippocampus, amygdala, entorhinal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, insula and superior frontal gyrus. Former college players showed significant volume reductions in the hippocampus, amygdala and superior frontal gyrus compared to the unexposed asymptomatic controls. We did not observe Age x Group interactions for brain morphometric measures. Interactions between morphometry and exposure measures were limited to a single significant positive association between the age of first exposure to organized tackle football and right insular volume. We found no significant relationship between brain morphometric measures and the TES diagnosis core clinical features and provisional level of certainty for CTE pathology outcomes. These findings suggested that MRI morphometrics detect abnormalities in individuals with a history of repetitive head impact exposure that resemble the anatomic distribution of pathological findings from post-mortem CTE studies. The lack of findings associating MRI measures with exposure metrics (except for one significant relationship) or TES diagnosis and core clinical features suggested that brain morphometry must be complemented by other types of measures to characterize individuals with repetitive head impacts.(c) The Author(s) 2024.

While differences between males and females have already been suggested following a concussion, whether there are sex differences following exposure to RSHI remains unknown. The aim of this study was to identify and to characterize sex differences following exposure to RSHI.\nMETHODS: Twenty-five collegiate ice hockey players (14 males and 11 females, 20.6 +- 2.0 years), all part of the Hockey Concussion Education Project (HCEP), underwent diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) before and after the Canadian Interuniversity Sports (CIS) ice hockey season 2011-2012 and did not experience a concussion during the season. Whole-brain tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) were used to compare pre- and postseason imaging in both sexes for fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD). Pre- and postseason neurocognitive performance were assessed by the Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Test (ImPACT).\nRESULTS: Significant differences between the sexes were primarily located within the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), the internal capsule (IC), and the corona radiata (CR) of the right hemisphere (RH). In significant voxel clusters (p &lt; 0.05), decreases in FA (absolute difference pre- vs. postseason: 0.0268) and increases in MD (0.0002), AD (0.00008), and RD (0.00005) were observed in females whereas males showed no significant changes. There was no significant correlation between the change in diffusion scalar measures over the course of the season and neurocognitive performance as evidenced from postseason ImPACT scores.\nCONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest sex differences in structural alterations following exposure to RSHI. Future studies need to investigate further the underlying mechanisms and association with exposure and clinical outcomes."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract:\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based brain segmentation has recently been revolutionized by deep learning methods. These methods use large numbers of annotated segmentations to train algorithms that have the potential to perform brain segmentations reliably and quickly. However, training data for these algorithms are frequently obtained from automated brain segmentation systems, which may contain inaccurate neuroanatomy. Thus, the neuroimaging community would benefit from an open source database of high quality, neuroanatomically curated and manually edited MRI brain images, as well as the publicly available tools and detailed procedures for generating these curated data. Manual segmentation approaches are regarded as the gold standard for brain segmentation and parcellation. These approaches underpin the construction of neuroanatomically accurate human brain atlases. In addition, neuroanatomically precise definitions of MRI-based regions of interest (ROIs) derived from manual brain segmentation are essential for accuracy in structural connectivity studies and in surgical planning for procedures such as deep brain stimulation. However, manual segmentation procedures are time and labor intensive, and not practical in studies utilizing very large datasets, large cohorts, or multimodal imaging. Automated segmentation methods were developed to overcome these issues, and provide high data throughput, increased reliability, and multimodal imaging capability. These methods utilize manually labeled brain atlases to automatically parcellate the brain into different ROIs, but do not have the anatomical accuracy of skilled manual segmentation approaches. In the present study, we developed a custom software module for manual editing of brain structures in the freely available 3D Slicer software platform that employs principles and tools based on pioneering work from the Center for Morphometric Analysis (CMA) at Massachusetts General Hospital. We used these novel 3D Slicer segmentation tools and techniques in conjunction with well-established neuroanatomical definitions of subcortical brain structures to manually segment 50 high resolution T1w MRI brains from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) Young Adult database. The structural definitions used herein are associated with specific neuroanatomical ontologies to systematically interrelate histological and MRI-based morphometric definitions. The resulting brain datasets are publicly available and will provide the basis for a larger database of anatomically curated brains as an open science resource.Copyright (c) 2022 Rushmore, Sunderland, Carrington, Chen, Halle, Lasso, Papadimitriou, Prunier, Rizzoni, Vessey, Wilson-Braun, Rathi, Kubicki, Bouix, Yeterian and Makris."

    "text": "Abstract:\nBACKGROUND: Exposure to repetitive head impacts (RHI) is associated with an increased risk of later-life neurobehavioral dysregulation and neurodegenerative disease. The underlying pathomechanisms are largely unknown.\nPURPOSE: To investigate whether RHI exposure is associated with later-life corpus callosum (CC) microstructure and whether CC microstructure is associated with plasma total tau and neuropsychological/neuropsychiatric functioning.\nSTUDY TYPE: Retrospective cohort study.\nPOPULATION: Seventy-five former professional American football players (age 55.2 +- 8.0 years) with cognitive, behavioral, and mood symptoms.\nFIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: Diffusion-weighted echo-planar MRI at 3 T.\nASSESSMENT: Subjects underwent diffusion MRI, venous puncture, neuropsychological testing, and completed self-report measures of neurobehavioral dysregulation. RHI exposure was assessed using the Cumulative Head Impact Index (CHII). Diffusion MRI measures of CC microstructure (i.e., free-water corrected fractional anisotropy (FA), trace, radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD)) were extracted from seven segments of the CC (CC1-7), using a tractography clustering algorithm. Neuropsychological tests were selected: Trail Making Test Part A (TMT-A) and Part B (TMT-B), Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT), Stroop Interference Test, and the Behavioral Regulation Index (BRI) from the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function, Adult version (BRIEF-A).\nSTATISTICAL TESTS: Diffusion MRI metrics were tested for associations with RHI exposure, plasma total tau, neuropsychological performance, and neurobehavioral dysregulation using generalized linear models for repeated measures.\nRESULTS: RHI exposure was associated with increased AD of CC1 (correlation coefficient (r) = 0.32, P &lt; 0.05) and with increased plasma total tau (r = 0.34, P &lt; 0.05). AD of the anterior CC1 was associated with increased plasma total tau (CC1: r = 0.30, P &lt; 0.05; CC2: r = 0.29, P &lt; 0.05). Higher trace, AD, and RD of CC1 were associated with better performance (P &lt; 0.05) in TMT-A (trace, r = 0.33; AD, r = 0.31; and RD, r = 0.28) and TMT-B (trace, r = 0.31; RD, r = 0.34). Higher FA and AD of CC2 were associated with better performance (P &lt; 0.05) in TMT-A (FA, r = 0.36; AD, r = 0.28), TMT-B (FA, r = 0.36; AD, r = 0.27), COWAT (FA, r = 0.36; AD, r = 0.32), and BRI (AD, r = 0.29).\nDATA CONCLUSION: These results suggest an association among RHI exposure, CC microstructure, plasma total tau, and clinical functioning in former professional American football players.\nLEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3 Technical Efficacy Stage: 1."

    "text": "Abstract:\nThe Accelerating Medicines Partnership(r) Schizophrenia (AMP(r) SCZ) project assesses a large sample of individuals at clinical high-risk for developing psychosis (CHR) and community controls. Subjects are enrolled in 43 sites across 5 continents. The assessments include domains similar to those acquired in previous CHR studies along with novel domains that are collected longitudinally across a period of 2 years. In parallel with the data acquisition, multidisciplinary teams of experts have been working to formulate the data analysis strategy for the AMP SCZ project. Here, we describe the key principles for the data analysis. The primary AMP SCZ analysis aim is to use baseline clinical assessments and multimodal biomarkers to predict clinical endpoints of CHR individuals. These endpoints are defined for the AMP SCZ study as transition to psychosis (i.e., conversion), remission from CHR syndrome, and persistent CHR syndrome (non-conversion/non-remission) obtained at one year and two years after baseline assessment. The secondary aim is to use longitudinal clinical assessments and multimodal biomarkers from all time points to identify clinical trajectories that differentiate subgroups of CHR individuals. The design of the analysis plan is informed by reviewing legacy data and the analytic approaches from similar international CHR studies. In addition, we consider properties of the newly acquired data that are distinct from the available legacy data. Legacy data are used to assist analysis pipeline building, perform benchmark experiments, quantify clinical concepts and to make design decisions meant to overcome the challenges encountered in previous studies. We present the analytic design of the AMP SCZ project, mitigation strategies to address challenges related to the analysis plan, provide rationales for key decisions, and present examples of how the legacy data have been used to support design decisions for the analysis of the multimodal and longitudinal data.

The multivariate model receives apriori knowledge in the form of a neighborhood graph imposed on the precision matrix, which models brain region interactions, and an additional L1 sparsity constraint. The model is then estimated using the graphical LASSO algorithm and the Mahalanobis distance of healthy and TBI subjects to the distribution mean is used to evaluate the discriminatory power of the model. Our experiments show that the addition of the apriori neighborhood graph results in significant improvements in classification performance compared to a model which does not take into account the brain region interactions or one which uses a fully connected prior graph. In addition, we describe a method, using our model, to detect the regions that contribute the most to the overall abnormality of the DTI profile of a subject’s brain.Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

    "text": "Abstract:\nThe gray matter/white matter (GM/WM) boundary of the brain is vulnerable to shear strain associated with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). It is, however, unknown whether GM/WM microstructure is associated with long-term outcomes following mTBI. The diffusion and structural MRI data of 278 participants between 18 and 65 years of age with and without military background from the Department of Defense INTRuST study were analyzed. Fractional anisotropy (FA) was extracted at the GM/WM boundary across the brain and for each lobe. Additionally, two conventional analytic approaches were used: whole-brain deep WM FA (TBSS) and whole-brain cortical thickness (FreeSurfer). ANCOVAs were applied to assess differences between the mTBI cohort (n = 147) and the comparison cohort (n = 131). Associations between imaging features and post-concussive symptom severity, and functional and cognitive impairment were investigated using partial correlations while controlling for mental health comorbidities that are particularly common among military cohorts and were present in both the mTBI and comparison group. Findings revealed significantly lower whole-brain and lobe-specific GM/WM boundary FA (p &lt; 0.011), and deep WM FA (p = 0.001) in the mTBI cohort. Whole-brain and lobe-specific GM/WM boundary FA was significantly negatively correlated with post-concussive symptoms (p &lt; 0.039), functional (p &lt; 0.016), and cognitive impairment (p &lt; 0.049). Deep WM FA was associated with functional impairment (p = 0.002). Finally, no significant difference was observed in cortical thickness, nor between cortical thickness and outcome (p &gt; 0.05). Findings from this study suggest that microstructural alterations at the GM/WM boundary may be sensitive markers of adverse long-term outcomes following mTBI."

    "text": "Abstract:\nBACKGROUND: Abnormalities in fronto-striatal-thalamic (FST) sub-circuits are present in schizophrenia and are associated with cognitive impairments. However, it remains unknown whether abnormalities in FST sub-circuits are present before psychosis onset. This may be elucidated by investigating 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS), a genetic syndrome associated with a 30% risk for developing schizophrenia in adulthood and a decline in Verbal IQ (VIQ) preceding psychosis onset. Here, we examined white matter (WM) tracts in FST sub-circuits, especially those in the dorsolateral (DLPFC) and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) sub-circuits, and their associations with VIQ in young adults with 22q11DS.\nMETHODS: Diffusion MRI scans were acquired from 21 individuals with 22q11DS with prodromal symptoms of schizophrenia, 30 individuals with 22q11DS without prodromal symptoms, and 30 healthy controls (mean age: 21 +- 2 years). WM tracts were reconstructed between striatum and thalamus with rostral middle frontal gyrus (rMFG) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), representing DLPFC and VLPFC respectively. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and radial diffusivity (RD) were used for group comparisons. VIQ was assessed and associations with the diffusion measures were evaluated.\nRESULTS: FA was significantly increased and RD decreased in most tracts of the DLPFC and VLPFC sub-circuits in 22q11DS. Verbal IQ scores correlated negatively with FA and, at trend level, positively with RD in the right thalamus-IFG tract in 22q11DS with prodromal symptoms.\nCONCLUSIONS: While abnormalities in FST sub-circuits are associated with schizophrenia, we observed that these abnormalities are also present in 22q11DS individuals with prodromal symptoms and are associated with verbal performance in the right thalamus-IFG tract."

    "text": "Abstract:\nPURPOSE: Flourine-18-flortaucipir tau positron emission tomography (PET) was developed for the detection for Alzheimer’s disease. Human imaging studies have begun to investigate its use in chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Flortaucipir-PET to autopsy correlation studies in CTE are needed for diagnostic validation. We examined the association between end-of-life flortaucipir PET and postmortem neuropathological measurements of CTE-related tau in six former American football players.\nMETHODS: Three former National Football League players and three former college football players who were part of the DIAGNOSE CTE Research Project died and agreed to have their brains donated. The six players had flortaucipir (tau) and florbetapir (amyloid) PET prior to death. All brains from the deceased participants were neuropathologically evaluated for the presence of CTE. On average, the participants were 59.0 (SD = 9.32) years of age at time of PET. PET scans were acquired 20.33 (SD = 13.08) months before their death. Using Spearman correlation analyses, we compared flortaucipir standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs) to digital slide-based AT8 phosphorylated tau (p-tau) density in a priori selected composite cortical, composite limbic, and thalamic regions-of-interest (ROIs).\nRESULTS: Four brain donors had autopsy-confirmed CTE, all with high stage disease (n = 3 stage III, n = 1 stage IV). Three of these four met criteria for the clinical syndrome of CTE, known as traumatic encephalopathy syndrome (TES). Two did not have CTE at autopsy and one of these met criteria for TES. Concomitant pathology was only present in one of the non-CTE cases (Lewy body) and one of the CTE cases (motor neuron disease). There was a strong association between flortaucipir SUVRs and p-tau density in the composite cortical (r = 0.71) and limbic (r = 0.77) ROIs. Although there was a strong association in the thalamic ROI (r = 0.83), this is a region with known off-target binding. SUVRs were modest and CTE and non-CTE cases had overlapping SUVRs and discordant p-tau density for some regions.\nCONCLUSIONS: Flortaucipir-PET could be useful for detecting high stage CTE neuropathology, but specificity to CTE p-tau is uncertain. Off-target flortaucipir binding in the hippocampus and thalamus complicates interpretation of these associations. In vivo biomarkers that can detect the specific p-tau of CTE across the disease continuum are needed."

Methods: Magnetic resonance images of 29 subjects with schizophrenia and 33 matched healthy controls were acquired. Brain gray matter was parcellated using FreeSurfer and 28 regions of interest associated with emotional awareness were analyzed. All participants were assessed using the Levels of Emotional Awareness Scale (LEAS) of Self and of Other. LEAS scores were correlated with gray matter volume for each hemisphere on the 14 brain regions of the emotional awareness network. Results: Individuals with schizophrenia showed decreased emotional awareness on both LEAS Self and LEAS Other compared to healthy controls. There were no statistically significant between-group differences in gray matter volumes of the emotional awareness network. The performance on LEAS Other correlated negatively with right precuneus gray matter volume only in the schizophrenia group. Conclusion: Our findings suggest a relationship between gray matter volume of the right precuneus and deficits in understanding of emotional states of others in schizophrenia.Copyright (c) 2021 Jani, Kikinis, Losak, Pasternak, Szczepankiewicz, Heller, Swago, Silva, Bouix, Kubicki, Ustohal, Kudlicka, Vojtisek, Westin and Kasparek."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract:\nDeletions and duplications at the 22q11.2 locus are associated with significant neurodevelopmental and psychiatric morbidity. Previous diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies in 22q11.2 deletion carriers (22q-del) found nonspecific white matter (WM) abnormalities, characterized by higher fractional anisotropy. Here, utilizing novel imaging and processing methods that allow separation of signal contribution from different tissue properties, we investigate whether higher anisotropy is driven by (1) extracellular changes, (2) selective degeneration of secondary fibers, or (3) volumetric differences. We further, for the first time, investigate WM microstructure in 22q11.2 duplication carriers (22q-dup). Multi-shell diffusion-weighted images were acquired from 26 22q-del, 19 22q-dup, and 18 healthy individuals (HC). Images were fitted with the free-water model to estimate anisotropy following extracellular free-water elimination and with the novel BedpostX model to estimate fractional volumes of primary and secondary fiber populations. Outcome measures were compared between groups, with and without correction for WM and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volumes. In 22q-del, anisotropy following free-water elimination remained significantly higher compared with controls. BedpostX did not identify selective secondary fiber degeneration. Higher anisotropy diminished when correcting for the higher CSF and lower WM volumes. In contrast, 22q-dup had lower anisotropy and greater extracellular space than HC, not influenced by macrostructural volumes. Our findings demonstrate opposing effects of reciprocal 22q11.2 copy-number variation on WM, which may arise from distinct pathologies. In 22q-del, microstructural abnormalities may be secondary to enlarged CSF space and more densely packed WM. In 22q-dup, we see evidence for demyelination similar to what is commonly observed in neuropsychiatric disorders.(c) 2021. The Author(s)."

    "text": "Abstract:\nTo date, few studies have evaluated the contribution of early life experiences to neurocognitive abnormalities observed in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Childhood maltreatment is common among individuals with PTSD and is thought to catalyze stress-related biobehavioral changes that might impact both brain structure and function in adulthood. The current study examined differences in brain morphology (brain volume, cortical thickness) and neuropsychological performance in individuals with PTSD characterized by low or high self-reported childhood maltreatment, compared with healthy comparison participants. Data were drawn from the INjury and TRaUmatic STress (INTRuST) Clinical Consortium imaging repository, which contains MRI and self-report data for individuals classified as PTSD positive (with and without a history of mild traumatic brain injury [mTBI]), individuals with mTBI only, and healthy comparison participants. The final sample included 36 individuals with PTSD without childhood maltreatment exposure (PTSD, n = 30 with mTBI), 31 individuals with PTSD and childhood maltreatment exposure (PTSD + M, n = 26 with mTBI), and 114 healthy comparison participants without history of childhood maltreatment exposure (HC). The PTSD + M and PTSD groups demonstrated cortical thinning in prefrontal and occipital regions, and poorer verbal memory and processing speed compared to the HC group. PTSD + M participants demonstrated cortical thinning in frontal and cingulate regions, and poorer executive functioning relative to the PTSD and HC groups. Thus, neurocognitive features varied between individuals with PTSD who did versus did not have exposure to childhood maltreatment, highlighting the need to assess developmental history of maltreatment when examining biomarkers in PTSD.Published by Elsevier Ltd."

    "text": "Abstract:\nIMPORTANCE: While remission from clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis is a favorable outcome, it is not well characterized over time.\nOBJECTIVE: To examine remission incidence, prevalence, and stability, and their association with demographic, clinical, medication, and cognitive variables, comparing 2 commonly used definitions.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study examined data from individuals aged 12 to 30 years at CHR in the North American Prodromal Longitudinal Study 3, collected from 9 sites across the US from February 2015 to November 2018. Statistical analyses were conducted between January 2023 and May 2025.\nEXPOSURE: CHR status using 2 definitions: (1) a symptoms-only definition based on the positive symptoms from the Scale of Prodromal Symptoms and (2) a symptoms-and-function definition based on positive symptoms and the modified Global Assessment of Functioning.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were remission incidence, prevalence, and stability for 7 follow-up visits over 2 years. Associations of remission with age, sex at birth, race, antipsychotic and antidepressant medication, history of trauma, and cognitive performance were determined using mixed-effects logistic regression.\nRESULTS: The sample included 692 individuals (mean [SD] age, 18.7 [4.1] years; 319 female [46%]) at baseline, with 614 completing at least 1 follow-up. For the symptoms-only definition, 7% (95% CI, 5%-10%) met remission criteria after 2 months, 34% (95% CI, 31%-38%) met remission criteria at least once during the study, and 26% (95% CI, 22%-29%) met criteria at their last visit. The symptoms-and-function definition was associated with a lower remission incidence and prevalence, with 4% (95%CI, 2%-5%) meeting remission criteria after 2 months, 21% (95% CI, 18%-24%) meeting criteria at least once, and 15% (95% CI, 13%-18%) meeting criteria at their last visit. Under the symptoms-only definition, 83 of 153 individuals at CHR with at least 1 follow-up after remission (54%; 95% CI, 46%-62%) were stable remitters. Under the symptoms-and-function definition, 43 of 91 individuals (47%; 95% CI, 37%-58%) were stable remitters. The chance of staying in remission rose drastically once a person had more than 1 previous recorded remission visit. Higher functioning was associated with higher likelihood of remission (current score for symptoms only: OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.08; current score for symptoms and function: OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.02-1.14). More symptoms at baseline was associated with a lower likelihood of remission (general symptoms for symptoms only: OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.70-0.84; general symptoms for symptoms and function: OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.69-0.92).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that CHR status is a dynamic state and that vulnerability can persist even after functional remission. Hence, continued follow-up and facilitated reengagement with clinical services after remission are essential."

    "text": "Abstract:\nNeuroimaging with MRI has been a frequent component of studies of individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for developing psychosis, with goals of understanding potential brain regions and systems impacted in the CHR state and identifying prognostic or predictive biomarkers that can enhance our ability to forecast clinical outcomes. To date, most studies involving MRI in CHR are likely not sufficiently powered to generate robust and generalizable neuroimaging results. Here, we describe the prospective, advanced, and modern neuroimaging protocol that was implemented in a complex multi-site, multi-vendor environment, as part of the large-scale Accelerating Medicines Partnership(r) Schizophrenia Program (AMP(r) SCZ), including the rationale for various choices. This protocol includes T1- and T2-weighted structural scans, resting-state fMRI, and diffusion-weighted imaging collected at two time points, approximately 2 months apart. We also present preliminary variance component analyses of several measures, such as signal- and contrast-to-noise ratio (SNR/CNR) and spatial smoothness, to provide quantitative data on the relative percentages of participant, site, and platform (i.e., scanner model) variance. Site-related variance is generally small (typically &lt;10%). For the SNR/CNR measures from the structural and fMRI scans, participant variance is the largest component (as desired; 40-76%). However, for SNR/CNR in the diffusion scans, there is substantial platform-related variance (&gt;55%) due to differences in the diffusion imaging hardware capabilities of the different scanners. Also, spatial smoothness generally has a large platform-related variance due to inherent, difficult to control, differences between vendors in their acquisitions and reconstructions. These results illustrate some of the factors that will need to be considered in analyses of the AMP SCZ neuroimaging data, which will be the largest CHR cohort to date.Watch Dr. Harms discuss this article at https://vimeo.com/1059777228?share=copy#t=0 .(c) 2025.

The aim of this paper is to describe the rationale, processes, considerations, and final harmonization of the cognitive battery used in AMP SCZ across the two data collection networks. This battery comprises tests of general intellect and specific cognitive domains. We estimate premorbid intelligence at baseline and measure current intelligence at baseline and 2 years. Eight tests from the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (PennCNB), which measure verbal learning and memory, sensorimotor ability, attention, emotion recognition, working memory, processing speed, verbal memory, visual memory, and motor speed are administered repeatedly at baseline, and four follow-up timepoints over 2 years.(c) 2025.

    "text": "Abstract:\nAlthough meta-analytic studies have shown that 25-33% of those at Clinical High Risk (CHR) for psychosis transition to a first episode of psychosis within three years, less is known about estimating the risk of transition at an individual level. Digital phenotyping offers a novel approach to explore the nature of CHR and may help to improve personalized risk prediction. Specifically, digital data enable detailed mapping of experiences, moods and behaviors during longer periods of time (e.g., weeks, months) and offer more insight into patterns over time at the individual level across their routine daily life. However, while novel digital health technologies open up many new avenues of research, they also come with specific challenges, including replicability of results and the adherence of participants. This paper outlines the design of the digital component of the Accelerating Medicines Partnership(r) Schizophrenia Program (AMP SCZ) project, a large international collaborative project that follows individuals at CHR for psychosis over a period of two years. The digital component comprises one-year smartphone-based digital phenotyping and actigraphy. Smartphone-based digital phenotyping includes 30-item short daily self-report surveys and voice diaries as well as passive data capture (geolocation, on/off screen state, and accelerometer). Actigraphy data are collected via an Axivity wristwatch. The aim of this paper is to describe the design and the three goals of the digital measures used in AMP SCZ to: (i) better understand the symptoms, real-life experiences, and behaviors of those at CHR for psychosis, (ii) improve the prediction of transition to psychosis and other health outcomes in this population based on digital phenotyping and, (iii) serve as an example for replicable and ethical research across geographically diverse regions and cultures. Accordingly, we describe the rationale, protocol and implementation of these digital components of the AMP SCZ project. **Link to video interview: https://vimeo.com/1060935583 *.(c) 2025.

Schizophrenia and psychosis risk are linked to polygenic scores for schizophrenia and other mental disorders, as well as to altered blood and saliva levels of biomarkers involved in hormonal signaling, redox balance, and chronic systemic inflammation. The Accelerating Medicines Partnership(r) Schizophrenia (AMP(r)SCZ) aims to ascertain biomarkers that both predict clinical outcomes and provide insights into the biological processes driving clinical outcomes in persons meeting CHR criteria. AMP(r)SCZ will follow almost 2000 CHR and 640 community study participants for two years, assessing biomarkers at baseline and two-month follow-up including the collection of blood and saliva samples. The following provides the rationale and methods for plans to utilize polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia and other disorders, salivary cortisol levels, and a discovery-based proteomic platform for plasma analyses. We also provide details about the standardized methods used to collect and store these biological samples, as well as the study participant metadata and quality control measures related to preanalytical factors that could influence the values of the biomarkers. Finally, we discuss our plans for analyzing the results of blood- and saliva-based biomarkers.

    "text": "Abstract:\nIndividuals at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR) have variable clinical outcomes and low conversion rates, limiting development of novel and personalized treatments. Moreover, given risks of antipsychotic drugs, safer effective medications for CHR individuals are needed. The Accelerating Medicines Partnership(r) Schizophrenia (AMP(r) SCZ) Program was launched to address this need. Based on past CHR and schizophrenia studies, AMP SCZ assessed electroencephalography (EEG)-based event-related potential (ERP), event-related oscillation (ERO), and resting EEG power spectral density (PSD) measures, including mismatch negativity (MMN), auditory and visual P300 to target (P3b) and novel (P3a) stimuli, 40-Hz auditory steady state response, and resting EEG PSD for traditional frequency bands (eyes open/closed). Here, in an interim analysis of AMP SCZ EEG measures, we assess test-retest reliability and stability over sessions (baseline, month-2 follow-up) in CHR (n = 654) and community control (CON; n = 87) participants. Reliability was calculated as Generalizability (G)-coefficients, and changes over session were assessed with paired t-tests. G-coefficients were generally good to excellent in both groups (CHR: mean = 0.72, range = 0.49-0.85; CON: mean = 0.71, range = 0.44-0.89). Measure magnitudes significantly (p &lt; 0.001) decreased over session (MMN, auditory and visual target P3b, visual novel P3a, 40-Hz ASSR) and/or over runs within sessions (MMN, auditory/visual novel P3a and target P3b), consistent with habituation effects. Despite these small systematic habituation effects, test-retest reliabilities of the AMP SCZ EEG-based measures are sufficiently strong to support their use in CHR studies as potential predictors of clinical outcomes, markers of illness progression, and/or target engagement or secondary outcome measures in controlled clinical trials.(c) 2025.

    "text": "Abstract:\nModern research management, particularly for publicly funded studies, assumes a data governance model in which grantees are considered stewards rather than owners of important data sets. Thus, there is an expectation that collected data are shared as widely as possible with the general research community. This presents problems in complex studies that involve sensitive health information. The latter requires balancing participant privacy with the needs of the research community. Here, we report on the data operation ecosystem crafted for the Accelerating Medicines Partnership(r) Schizophrenia project, an international observational study of young individuals at clinical high risk for developing a psychotic disorder. We review data capture systems, data dictionaries, organization principles, data flow, security, quality control protocols, data visualization, monitoring, and dissemination through the NIMH Data Archive platform. We focus on the interconnectedness of these steps, where our goal is to design a seamless data flow and an alignment with the FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) principles while balancing local regulatory and ethical considerations. This process-oriented approach leverages automated pipelines for data flow to enhance data quality, speed, and collaboration, underscoring the project’s contribution to advancing research practices involving multisite studies of sensitive mental health conditions. An important feature is the data’s close-to-real-time quality assessment (QA) and quality control (QC). The focus on close-to-real-time QA/QC makes it possible for a subject to redo a testing session, as well as facilitate course corrections to prevent repeating errors in future data acquisition.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract:\nOBJECTIVE: Psychomotor function is a critical marker of risk and outcome of psychosis. Grip strength is one aspect of psychomotor function that is known to be linked to structural neural integrity and well-being. This study sought to determine whether grip strength is a marker of alterations in resting-state connectivity and well-being in psychotic disorders in order to further clarify the mechanisms by which psychosis phenomenology is related to psychomotor processes.\nMETHODS: The authors analyzed resting-state functional MRI and grip strength in 89 individuals with early psychosis and 51 control subjects without psychiatric disorders from the Human Connectome Project for Early Psychosis. Participants ranged in age from 16 to 35 years. Using multivariate pattern analysis of whole-connectome data, the authors identified brain correlates of grip strength and then replicated this analysis using the NIH Toolbox well-being measures and the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF).\nRESULTS: The psychosis group exhibited reduced grip strength, well-being, and GAF scores compared to the control group. Grip strength was linked to resting-state connectivity in the sensorimotor cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and cerebellum. Connectivity correlated with the default mode network (DMN) (rsensorimotor=0.22, rcingulate=0.30, rcerebellum=0.24). When the analysis was repeated for GAF and well-being, overlapping regions in the sensorimotor cortex and cerebellum were connected to the DMN and related to GAF (rsensorimotor=0.17, rcerebellum=0.28) and well-being (rsensorimotor=0.16, rcerebellum=0.16). Relationships were driven by the psychosis group for cerebellum and cingulate nodes.\nCONCLUSIONS: Data-driven, connectome-wide analysis identified shared brain correlates of grip strength, overall function, and well-being in a sample of young adults with psychosis and healthy control subjects. This suggests that grip strength may be a marker of DMN connectivity, which may in turn be an important marker of overall health, even in young adult populations."

    "text": "Abstract:\nClinical ascertainment and clinical outcome are key features of any large multisite study. In the ProNET and PRESCIENT research networks, the Accelerating Medicines Partnership(r) Schizophrenia (AMP(r)SCZ) Clinical Ascertainment and Outcome Measures Team aimed to establish a harmonized clinical assessment protocol across these two research networks and to define ascertainment criteria and primary and secondary endpoints. In addition to developing the assessment protocol, the goals of this aspect of the AMP SCZ project were: (1) to implement and monitor clinical training, ascertainment of participants, and clinical assessments; (2) to provide expert clinical input to the Psychosis Risk Evaluation, Data Integration and Computational Technologies: Data Processing, Analysis, and Coordination Center (PREDICT-DPACC) for data collection, quality control, and preparation of data for the analysis of the clinical measures; and (3) to provide ongoing support to the collection, analysis, and reporting of clinical data. This paper describes the (1) protocol clinical endpoints and outcomes, (2) rationale for the selection of the clinical measures, (3) extensive training of clinical staff, (4) preparation of clinical measures for a multisite study which includes several sites where English is not the native language; and (5) the assessment of measure stability over time in the AMP SCZ observational study comparing clinical ratings at baseline and at the 2-month follow up.

    "text": "Abstract:\nThe Accelerating Medicines Partnership(r) Schizophrenia (AMP(r) SCZ) project assesses a large sample of individuals at clinical high-risk for developing psychosis (CHR) and community controls. Subjects are enrolled in 43 sites across 5 continents. The assessments include domains similar to those acquired in previous CHR studies along with novel domains that are collected longitudinally across a period of 2 years. In parallel with the data acquisition, multidisciplinary teams of experts have been working to formulate the data analysis strategy for the AMP SCZ project. Here, we describe the key principles for the data analysis. The primary AMP SCZ analysis aim is to use baseline clinical assessments and multimodal biomarkers to predict clinical endpoints of CHR individuals. These endpoints are defined for the AMP SCZ study as transition to psychosis (i.e., conversion), remission from CHR syndrome, and persistent CHR syndrome (non-conversion/non-remission) obtained at one year and two years after baseline assessment. The secondary aim is to use longitudinal clinical assessments and multimodal biomarkers from all time points to identify clinical trajectories that differentiate subgroups of CHR individuals. The design of the analysis plan is informed by reviewing legacy data and the analytic approaches from similar international CHR studies. In addition, we consider properties of the newly acquired data that are distinct from the available legacy data. Legacy data are used to assist analysis pipeline building, perform benchmark experiments, quantify clinical concepts and to make design decisions meant to overcome the challenges encountered in previous studies. We present the analytic design of the AMP SCZ project, mitigation strategies to address challenges related to the analysis plan, provide rationales for key decisions, and present examples of how the legacy data have been used to support design decisions for the analysis of the multimodal and longitudinal data.

Lived experience is embedded in the program’s governance, shaping study protocols, recruitment strategies, and digital tools such as the mindLAMP platform. Study sites also integrate lived experience through youth advisory boards, peer support specialists, and advisory committees, ensuring diverse perspectives inform research design and implementation. These efforts aim to develop predictive tools and therapeutic strategies while maintaining ethical and participant-centered practices. Advocacy organizations, such as the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), have fostered collaboration among government, industry, and academic partners, shaping outreach and engagement strategies. Dissemination efforts, led by the Website and Outreach Workgroup (WOW), include an accessible, Section 508-compliant website and co-designed resources, building trust and engagement within communities. By integrating lived experience at every stage, the program aims to foster trust, enhance research outcomes, and inform future strategies for treatment and prevention.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract of the article:\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a common and life-saving medical imaging technique. However, acquiring high signal-to-noise ratio MRI scans requires long scan times, resulting in increased costs and patient discomfort, and decreased throughput. Thus, there is great interest in denoising MRI scans, especially for the subtype of diffusion MRI scans that are severely SNR-limited. While most prior MRI denoising methods are supervised in nature, acquiring supervised training datasets for the multitude of anatomies, MRI scanners, and scan parameters proves impractical. Here, we propose Denoising Diffusion Models for Denoising Diffusion MRI (DDM ), a self-supervised denoising method for MRI denoising using diffusion denoising generative models. Our three-stage framework integrates statistic-based denoising theory into diffusion models and performs denoising through conditional generation. During inference, we represent input noisy measurements as a sample from an intermediate posterior distribution within the diffusion Markov chain. We conduct experiments on 4 real-world in-vivo diffusion MRI datasets and show that our DDM demonstrates superior denoising performances ascertained with clinically-relevant visual qualitative and quantitative metrics."
