# Description:

TorchIO is an open-source Python library for efficient loading, preprocessing, augmentation and patch-based sampling of 3D medical images in deep learning, following the design of PyTorch.

It includes multiple intensity and spatial transforms for data augmentation and preprocessing. These transforms include typical computer vision operations such as random affine transformations and also domain-specific ones such as simulation of intensity artifacts due to MRI magnetic field inhomogeneity (bias) or k-space motion artifacts.

TorchIO is part of the official PyTorch Ecosystem, and was featured at the PyTorch Ecosystem Day 2021 and the PyTorch Developer Day 2021.

Many groups have used TorchIO for their research. The complete list of citations is available on Google Scholar, and the dependents list is available on GitHub.

The code is available on GitHub. If you like TorchIO, please go to the repository and star it!
