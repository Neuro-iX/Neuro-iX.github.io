# Conclusion:
- Results of UNesT and ANTs showed race matching improves segmentation accuracy
- nnU-net the only model that its performance is indifferent to the race-matching and sex-matching of training set and test set
- Sex differences observed with manual segmentation on the volumes can also be observed with biased models, whereas the race
differences disappear in all but one model
- Most models show a lower overall Dice coefÔ¨Åcient score and ESSP when trained on datasets from black demographic groups than
those trained on white demographic groups.
